In the next section, we will explore the DALL-E AI art generation AI model and cover the basics of the DALL-E API.

## Using DALL-E and the DALL-E API <a href="#_idtextanchor115" id="_idtextanchor115"></a>

DALL-E is a remarkable AI model, that can generate stunning images from textual descriptions. In this section, you will gain an understanding of the concept behind DALL-E and its groundbreaking approach to image synthesis. You’ll learn about the unique capabilities of DALL-E in translating text prompts into vibrant and imaginative visual representations. Additionally, we’ll explore the practical application of DALL-E through the DALL-E API, empowering you to seamlessly integrate this powerful technology into your own applications and unlock a myriad of creative possibilities.

DALL-E is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It was introduced to the world in January 2021. DALL-E is a neural network-based model that combines elements of the ChatGPT language models with a generative adversarial network **GAN** architecture. The name DALL-E is a playful combination of the artist Salvador Dalí and the character WALL-E from the animated film. This unique model was designed to generate highly realistic and novel images based on textual descriptions, showcasing the incredible potential of AI in the field of visual creativity. By training on a massive dataset of images and textual prompts, DALL-E can create intricate and imaginative visual outputs, providing a glimpse into the groundbreaking advancements in AI-driven image synthesis.

Using DALL-E from the web provides an interactive and user-friendly approach to generating AI art. You can harness the capabilities of DALL-E through the web interface by following these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the DALL-E web[site at https://labs.op](https://labs.openai.com/)enai.com. You can use your OpenAI credentials to access DALL-E.
2. On the DALL-E web page, you’ll find a text input box where you can enter a textual description of the image you want to generate (see _Figure 9.1_). Be as specific or creative as you like in your description. For example, you can enter _a yellow banana wearing sunglasses on a beach._
3. Once you’ve entered your text prompt, click the **Generate** button to trigger the image generation process. The DALL-E model will interpret your description and generate a corresponding image based on its understanding of the text.
4. After a moment, the generated image will be displayed on the web page. Take a moment to examine the output and observe how DALL-E has interpreted your text prompt. If necessary, you can iterate and refine your description to achieve the desired image.
5. Feel free to experiment with different text prompts, explore various concepts, and observe how DALL-E transforms your ideas into visual representations. This interactive process allows you to explore AI-generated art and encourages creative exploration.

![Figure 9.1: DALL-E web interface](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_09\_1.jpg)

Figure 9.1: DALL-E web interface

You can integrate DALL-E directly into your own application by using the DALL-E API. It provides a convenient interface to interact with DALL-E, enabling users to generate images based on custom textual prompts programmatically.

To use the DALL-E API, you can use the same API key from your OpenAI account. Once you have your API key, you can make requests to the API endpoint, specifying the text prompt for which you want to generate an image. You can create a single Python file and generate your first DALL-E image within a few lines of code. The API will process the request and return the generated image as a response, as shown in the following code example:

```
response = openai.Image.create(
    prompt="A cat sitting on a cloud",
    n=1,
    size="1024x1024"
)
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
```

The provided code demonstrates how to use the **openai.Image.create()** function to generate an image using the DALL-E API and retrieve the URL of the generated image.

The **prompt** parameter serves as the textual description or instruction for the desired image. This prompt provides guidance to the DALL-E model on what the generated image should depict. The **size** parameter determines the dimensions of the generated image, indicating a square image with a resolution of 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels.

After making the API request, the response is stored in the **response** variable. The code then retrieves the URL of the generated image from the API response. The URL is obtained by accessing the appropriate keys in the response dictionary. By assigning **response** to **image\_url**, the URL of the generated image is stored for further use in any application.

This is how you can use both the DALL-E user-friendly web interface to generate AI art and the DALL-E API to integrate that AI art into your own applications. In the next section, we will do that by launching our PowerPoint Presentation Generator app.

## Building PowerPoint Apps with the PPTX Python Framework <a href="#_idtextanchor116" id="_idtextanchor116"></a>

In this section, we will guide you through the process of setting up your very own PowerPoint Presentation Generator app using the **pptx** Python library and the ChatGPT API. We’ll explore how to leverage the power of the **pptx** library to automate the creation of PowerPoint presentations, allowing you to dynamically generate slides with customized content. Furthermore, we’ll demonstrate how to integrate this PowerPoint generation functionality into a Tkinter application, enabling you to build a user-friendly interface for your slide generator.

For this project, we will use the PyCharm IDE, which is our preferred IDE when working with Python. Launch PyCharm and click on **Create New Project** or go to **File** | **New Project**. Choose the location where you want to create your project and name it **PowerPoint Generator**. Keep the default settings and click on the **Create** button.

Once your project is open, you can find the **Terminal** tab at the bottom of the PyCharm interface. It is in the tool window area, alongside other tabs such as **Project**, **Version Control**, and **Run**. Once the terminal tab is open, you can start using it just like a regular command-line interface to install the necessary libraries for our project:

```
$pip install python-pptx
$pip install openai
$pip install requests
```

Here is how we are going to use those libraries:

* **python-pptx**: The **python-pptx** package is used for working with PowerPoint files (**.pptx**) and provides functionalities to create, modify, and automate the development of PowerPoint presentations programmatically
* **openai**: The **openai** package provides access to the OpenAI API, which allows you to interact with AI models such as DALL-E and ChatGPT, enabling you to utilize their capabilities in your Python applications
* **requests**: The **requests** package is used for making HTTP requests and is used to communicate with the DALL-E API and retrieve the generated image URL after sending a request

We can continue developing our project structure by creating two files, **app.py** and **config.py**:

app.py

```
import collections.abc
import config
assert collections
import tkinter as tk
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
import openai
from io import BytesIO
import requests
# API Token
openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
```

config.py

```
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Here, the **app.py** file is the core of the application and serves as the main entry point. It imports various libraries and modules to enable connection to the ChatGPT, DALL-E, and PowerPoint frameworks. Here’s a breakdown of the imports and their purposes:

* **collections.abc** is imported to ensure compatibility with collections from the Python Standard Library
* **config** is imported to access the **API\_KEY** variable, which holds the API key required for authentication with the OpenAI API
* **tkinter** is imported to utilize the Tkinter library for building the user interface of the application
* **pptx** and **pptx.util** are imported to work with PowerPoint files, allowing the application to create and modify PowerPoint presentations programmatically
* **openai** is imported to interact with the OpenAI API and access its services, such as language models and image generation
* **io** and **requests** are imported to handle input/output operations and make HTTP requests respectively

On the other hand, the **config.py** file serves as a configuration file for the project. It contains the API key, represented by the **API\_KEY** variable, which is required for authentication with the OpenAI API. By separating the API key into a configuration file, it becomes easier to manage and update the key without modifying the main application code directly. This modular approach allows for better organization and flexibility in handling sensitive information.

Next, inside our **app.py** file, we will focus on building the Tkinter application window, which will serve as the **graphical user interface** (**GUI**) for our PowerPoint presentation generator:

```
app = tk.Tk()
app.title("Crate PPT Slides")
app.geometry("800x600")
# Create text field
text_field = tk.Text(app)
text_field.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
text_field.configure(wrap="word", font=("Arial", 12))
text_field.focus_set()
# Create the button to create slides
create_button = tk.Button(app, text="Create Slides", command=get_slides)
create_button.pack()
app.mainloop()
```

Here, we create the Tkinter application frame that will allow users to generate PowerPoint slides based on the input text.

Firstly, the code initializes a Tkinter application window using the **tk.Tk()** function. The **app** variable is assigned as the application instance. We set a title for the application window, which will be displayed in the window’s title bar. Then we set the initial size of the application window to **800** pixels in width and **600** pixels in height.

We also create a text field using the **tk.Text()** function. This text field is used to accept user input for generating PowerPoint slides. The **pack()** method is called to place the text field within the application window. The **configure()** method is used to customize the text field’s appearance. In this case, **wrap="word"** is set to wrap the text at word boundaries.

Lastly, we create a button using the **tk.Button()** function. The button is labeled **Create Slides** using the **text** parameter, and the **command** parameter is set to **get\_slides**. This means that when the button is clicked, the **get\_slides** function will be called.

Next, we will proceed to build the **get\_slides()** function, which will be responsible for creating the PowerPoint presentation and slides. It is important to note that the **get\_slides()** function should be defined above the lines that create the Tkinter application window and the associated widgets. This ensures that the function is defined and available for use when the application interacts with the user:

<pre><code><strong>def get_slides():
</strong><strong>    text = text_field.get("1.0", "end-1c")
</strong><strong>    paragraphs = text.split("\n\n")
</strong><strong>    prs = Presentation()
</strong><strong>    width = Pt(1920)
</strong><strong>    height = Pt(1080)
</strong><strong>    prs.slide_width = width
</strong><strong>    prs.slide_height = height
</strong><strong>    for paragraph in paragraphs:
</strong><strong>        slide_generator(paragraph, prs)
</strong><strong>    prs.save("my_presentation.pptx")
</strong>app = tk.Tk()
app.title("Crate PPT Slides")
app.geometry("800x600")
# Create text field
text_field = tk.Text(app)
text_field.pack(fill="both", expand=True)
text_field.configure(wrap="word", font=("Arial", 12))
text_field.focus_set()
# Create the button to create slides
create_button = tk.Button(app, text="Create Slides",     command=get_slides)
create_button.pack()
app.mainloop()
</code></pre>

Here, the **text\_field.get()** method is used to retrieve the contents of the text field. The **1.0** parameter indicates that the retrieval should start from the first character of the text field, and **end-1c** indicates that the retrieval should end at the last character excluding the newline character. This allows us to obtain the entire text entered by the user.

Next, the text string is split into paragraphs. The **\n** delimiter is used to identify the paragraphs, assuming that each paragraph is separated by two consecutive newline characters. This split operation will create a list of paragraphs stored in the **paragraphs** variable.

A new PowerPoint presentation object is created using **prs = Presentation()**. This initializes an empty presentation that will store the generated slides. Then we set the dimensions of the slides to **1920** points in width and the height is set to **1080** points.

A loop is then initiated to iterate over each paragraph in the **paragraphs** list. For each paragraph, the **slide\_generator()** function is called, passing the paragraph and the presentation object as parameters. This function, which will be implemented separately, is responsible for creating individual slides based on the content of each paragraph.

Once the loop finishes, the generated presentation object is saved as a PowerPoint file. The resulting PowerPoint file will be named **my\_presentation.pptx** and will contain the slides created from the user’s input.

To test your application at this early stage, you can click the **Run** button in your PyCharm IDE. Once the app is running, you will see a Tkinter window titled **Create PPT Slides**, as shown in _Figure 9.2_, with a text field and a **Create Slides** button. The text field allows you to enter the content for your PowerPoint slides, and the button triggers the **get\_slides()** function, which generates the slides based on the input text.

![Figure 9.2: PowerPoint Presentation Generator GUI](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_09\_2.jpg)

Figure 9.2: PowerPoint Presentation Generator GUI

However, at this point, if you try to generate the AI slides, you will encounter an error. This is because the **slide\_generator()** function, which is responsible for creating the AI art and text for our slides, has not been defined yet.

In the upcoming section, we’ll jump into building the **slide\_generator()** function, where the text provided by the user will be transformed into AI art using the DALL-E API. This function will access the capabilities of the DALL-E API to generate images based on the text input, allowing for the creation of stunning slides with AI-generated artwork.

## Generating Art with the DALL-E API <a href="#_idtextanchor117" id="_idtextanchor117"></a>

In this section, we will explore the exciting integration of the ChatGPT API and the DALL-E API. We will demonstrate how these two powerful artificial intelligence tools can be combined to create unique and visually stunning artwork. By leveraging the ChatGPT API, we will generate a DALL-E prompt based on user-provided paragraphs from our application. We will then utilize the DALL-E API to transform that prompt into a captivating image.

To begin, we can start building the **slide\_generator()** function, which will play a crucial role in generating the PowerPoint slides based on the user’s input. It is important to note that this function should be created right after the API key definition in the **app.py** file and above the **get\_slides()** function. Placing it in this position ensures that it is defined and available for use when we invoke it within the **get\_slides()** function. This approach allows for the structured organization of the code and ensures the smooth execution of the slide generation process:

```
def slide_generator(text, prs):
    prompt = f"Summarize the following text to a DALL-E image              generation " \
             f"prompt: \n {text}"
    model_engine = "gpt-4"
    dlp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_engine,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "I will ask you a question"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
        ],
        max_tokens=250,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.8
    )
    dalle_prompt = dlp["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    dalle_prompt = dlp.choices[0].text
    response = openai.Image.create(
        prompt=dalle_prompt + " Style: digital art",
        n=1,
        size="1024x1024"
    )
image_url = response['data'][0]['url']
```

This is how we can define the **slide\_generator()** function, responsible for generating a DALL-E image generation prompt based on the user-provided text and integrating it with the ChatGPT API. This function takes two parameters: **text**, which represents the user’s input, and **prs**, which refers to the PowerPoint presentation object.

The **prompt** variable is defined by concatenating a static introductory text with the user-provided **text**. This prompt will be used to instruct the ChatGPT model to summarize the given text into a DALL-E image generation prompt.

The **create()** method is then called to make a request to the ChatGPT API for text completion. The JSON response from the ChatGPT API is stored in the **dlp** variable, which contains the completion result. The actual text from the ChatGPT completion result is extracted and assigned to the **dalle\_prompt** variable. This **dalle\_prompt** variable will serve as the input prompt for the DALL-E image generation API.

Now we can begin using the DALL-E API to generate an image based on the DALL-E prompt created in the **slide\_generator** function. We call the **openai.Image.create()** method to make a request to the DALL-E API for image generation using the following parameters:

* **prompt**: The prompt for the image generation, which is constructed by appending **dalle\_prompt** (generated by the ChatGPT API) with the desired style for the image, specified as **Style: digital art**. This prompts DALL-E to generate an image with a digital art style based on the text input. You can change this style according to your preferences.
* **n**: Specifies the number of images to generate. In this case, we request only one image.
* **size**: Sets the desired size of the generated image. Here, it is specified as **1024x1024** pixels, which is the highest-quality style.

The response from the DALL-E API is stored in the **response** variable. It contains information about the generated image, including its URL. The URL of the generated image is extracted from the response and assigned to the **image\_url** variable. This URL can be used to retrieve and display the generated image in our PowerPoint slides.

In this section, we’ve built the **slide\_generator()** function to generate a DALL-E prompt using the ChatGPT API based on user input, and then utilized the DALL-E API to generate an image with a desired style. This integration allows us to create visually stunning artwork and enhance the quality and impact of our PowerPoint slides.

In the next section, we will cover the creation of slide headers and bullet points in our PowerPoint presentation. We will demonstrate how to incorporate AI-generated images and text into slides.

## Finalizing and Testing the AI Presentation Generator <a href="#_idtextanchor118" id="_idtextanchor118"></a>

In this final section, you will learn the process of creating slide content for our PowerPoint presentations using AI-generated images and text. We will explore how to seamlessly integrate AI-generated elements, including images from DALL-E and text from ChatGPT, into our slides. By following the steps outlined here, you will be able to pass AI-generated content to your PowerPoint slides, adding a touch of uniqueness and sophistication to your presentations.

You will learn how to retrieve an AI-generated image URL and apply it as a slide background or insert it into a specific slide element. Additionally, you will incorporate AI-generated text as bullet points in a slide. By combining the power of AI image generation with ChatGPT’s text completion capabilities, users will be able to enrich their slides with visually appealing images and relevant text.

To begin, we will demonstrate how to create slide headers and bullet points using AI-generated images and text. To generate that content, you can include the following code snippet in your **slide\_generator()** function:

```
    prompt = f"Create a bullet point text for a Powerpoint" \
             f"slide from the following text: \n {text}"
    ppt = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_engine,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "I will ask you a question"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
        ],
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.8
    )
    ppt_text = ppt["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    prompt = f"Create a title for a Powerpoint" \
             f"slide from the following text: \n {text}"
    ppt = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_engine,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "I will ask you a question"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
        ],
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        stop=None,
        temperature=0.8
    )
    ppt_header = ppt["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

In the first part of the code, a **prompt** string is constructed using a single paragraph entered by the user in the app. This prompt asks the AI model to generate a bullet-point text for a PowerPoint slide. The prompt is then passed to the ChatGPT **create()** method. The result of the completion is stored in the **ppt** variable, and the generated bullet point text is extracted from **ppt.choices\[0].text** and assigned to the **ppt\_text** variable.

Similarly, in the second part of the code, another **prompt** string is constructed to ask the AI model to generate a title for a PowerPoint slide based on the same user-provided text. The text result of the completion is extracted from **ppt.choices\[0].text** and assigned to the **ppt\_header** variable.

This generated bullet-point text and title will be used next to create the actual PowerPoint slides. You can include the following code, adding a new slide to the PowerPoint presentation and populating it with an image, bullet point text, and a title:

```
# Add a new slide to the presentation
slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[1])
response = requests.get(image_url)
img_bytes = BytesIO(response.content)
slide.shapes.add_picture(img_bytes, Inches(1), Inches(1))
# Add text box
txBox = slide.shapes.add_textbox(Inches(3), Inches(1),
                                 Inches(4), Inches(1.5))
tf = txBox.text_frame
tf.text = ppt_text
title_shape = slide.shapes.title
title_shape.text = ppt_header
```

First, a new slide is added to the presentation using the **add\_slide()** method. The method takes the desired slide layout as an argument, which in this case, represents the layout for a content slide.

Next, an HTTP request is made to retrieve the image from the image URL. The response is obtained, and its content is read into a **BytesIO** object named **img\_bytes**. This allows the image data to be accessed and processed. To add the image to the slide, the **add\_picture()** method is used. It takes the **img\_bytes** object, along with the desired positioning parameters, as arguments. In this case, the image is positioned **1** inch from the left and **1** inch from the top of the slide.

A textbox is then added to the slide using the **slide.shapes.add\_textbox()** method. The method takes the positioning parameters for the textbox as arguments. The text frame of the textbox is accessed using the **txBox.text\_frame** attribute, and the **ppt\_text** variable, which contains the generated bullet-point text, is assigned to **tf.text**. This sets the content of the textbox to the AI-generated text.

Finally, the title shape of the slide is accessed. The **ppt\_header** variable, which contains the generated title text, is assigned to **title\_shape.text**. This sets the title of the slide to the AI-generated title.

In that way, our presentation will be populated with the desired content, including images, bullet-point text, and titles.

Your PowerPoint Presentation Generator app is now complete and ready to be tested. To avoid any unexpected errors, you can verify that your lines of code are correct using the complete **app.py** file from Git: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/blob/main/Chapter09%20PowerPoint%20Generator/app.py](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/blob/main/Chapter09%20PowerPoint%20Generator/app.py).

To run the app, simply execute the code or run the **app.py** file. This will launch the Tkinter application window, which serves as the user interface for your slide generator.

Once the app is running, you will see an application window with a text field where you can enter the content for your slides. Simply type or paste the desired text into the text field. For this example, we used an article about jellyfish (see _Figure 9.3_).

_Jellyfish, also known as medusas or sea jellies, are fascinating creatures that inhabit the world’s oceans. They belong to the phylum Cnidaria and are characterized by their gelatinous bodies and tentacles. Jellyfish come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from small and transparent to large and vibrant. They have a unique life cycle, starting as a polyp attached to the ocean floor before transforming into a free-swimming medusa._

_One of the most intriguing aspects of jellyfish is their ability to sting. They possess specialized cells called cnidocytes, which contain nematocysts that deliver venomous toxins. These stinging cells allow jellyfish to capture prey and defend themselves from potential predators. While most jellyfish stings are harmless to humans, some species can cause painful or even dangerous reactions. It is advisable to exercise caution when swimming in waters known to have jellyfish populations._

_Jellyfish play important roles in marine ecosystems. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming small planktonic organisms, fish eggs, and even other jellyfish. As predators, they help maintain a balance in the marine food web. Additionally, jellyfish have a unique ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions._

You can either use the text provided, or you can experiment with a text depending on your preferences.

Important Note

Ensure that you include a double line break between each paragraph to properly indicate the separation between paragraphs, allowing your application to accurately identify and distinguish them.

![Figure 9.3: Populating the PowerPoint Presentation Generator with Text Input](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_09\_3.jpg)

Figure 9.3: Populating the PowerPoint Presentation Generator with Text Input

Now you can click on the **Create Slides** button to generate the PowerPoint slides based on the entered text. Within a matter of seconds, your presentation will be swiftly generated and saved in the primary directory of your project.

Important Note

OpenAI has a rate limit that specifies the allowed number of tokens that can be used per minute. If you use the application extensively, it is possible that you will reach the free-trial rate limit, which is currently 40,000 tokens per minute.

Upon opening the presentation, you will be greeted with three slides, with each slide dedicated to a paragraph of the input text. These slides will showcase captivating AI art images created by DALL-E, accompanied by concise bullet points and a distinctive title for each slide (see _Figure 9.4_).

![Figure 9.4: Slides Generated by the PowerPoint Presentation Generator App](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_09\_4.jpg)

Figure 9.4: Slides Generated by the PowerPoint Presentation Generator App

To enhance the visual arrangement of elements on the slide, you have the flexibility to utilize the built-in **Designer** option within PowerPoint, conveniently located in the top-right corner.

That was the complete process of completing and testing the DALL-E AI presentation generator. You learned how to generate slide headers, bullet points, and AI-generated images. We covered the construction of AI prompts and retrieving the generated content. The section also outlined how to populate a PowerPoint presentation with generated content, including images, bullet points, and titles.

## Summary <a href="#_idtextanchor119" id="_idtextanchor119"></a>

This chapter explored the capabilities of DALL-E, an advanced AI model, to generate realistic, novel images based on textual descriptions. You learned how to integrate DALL-E into your own applications using the DALL-E API. Additionally, we guided you in developing a PowerPoint Presentation Generator app using the **pptx** Python library and the ChatGPT API. We built the GUI using Tkinter, allowing users to generate slides with the **get\_slides()** function, which retrieved user input and created a PowerPoint presentation.

We built the **slide\_generator()** function, which played a key role in transforming the user input into AI-generated slides. The chapter also provided instructions for seamlessly incorporating AI-generated images and text, such as bullet points and slide headers, into the PowerPoint slides. We tested our AI Presentation Generator app, enabling you to run and evaluate your enhanced PowerPoint presentations.

In [_Chapter 10_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-ai-applications/9781805127567/B21110\_10.xhtml#\_idTextAnchor120), titled _Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech with the Whisper API_, you will learn how to utilize the Whisper API for audio transcription. We will focus on a practical project that involves transcribing various file types into text to create subtitles using human-level robustness and accuracy in English speech recognition.
