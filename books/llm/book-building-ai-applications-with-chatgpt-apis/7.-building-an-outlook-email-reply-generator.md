## 7. Building an Outlook Email Reply Generator <a href="#_idparadest-88" id="_idparadest-88"></a>

Email communication is an essential part of our personal and professional lives. However, crafting the perfect email response can be a time-consuming and challenging task. This is where **artificial intelligence** (**AI**) can come in handy. Using the **ChatGPT API**, you will learn how to generate automatic email replies that are both relevant and personalized to the sender’s message.

Many companies have already started using AI to generate email replies to save time and increase productivity. For example, Google’s Smart Reply feature uses machine learning algorithms to generate short, concise email responses that are contextually relevant to the message at hand. Similarly, we can use OpenAI’s most powerful natural language processing model, GPT-4, to generate more complex replies compared to GPT-3, helping us to develop personalized email replies.

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build an **Outlook email reply generator** using OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model. You will be able to build an app that automatically generates original replies to specific emails integrating the **Outlook API** and OpenAI’s GPT-4. This will help you to save time and increase your productivity by automating the process of crafting well-written email responses. You will also learn how to use the Outlook API to send data to the ChatGPT API, and how to automate ChatGPT API prompts to get relevant email replies.

For this project, in addition to the **tkinter** and **openai** libraries, we’ll use the **win32com** library in Python to interact with **Microsoft Outlook** and retrieve email data. This library provides us with a powerful set of tools to access the **Outlook’s APIs** and retrieve email messages. By using **win32com**, we can easily retrieve the subject and body of an email message and use it as input for OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model. Together with **tkinter** and **openai**, **win32com** provides us with a comprehensive set of tools to build a powerful and user-friendly email reply generator.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

* Using the **win32com** library to interact with Microsoft Outlook
* Using the Outlook API to send data to the ChatGPT API
* Designing effective prompts for automatic email replies
* Using **tkinter** to build a simple GUI desktop app for the email reply generator

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to generate and send original email replies using **natural language processing** (**NLP**) techniques and a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Technical Requirements <a href="#_idtextanchor097" id="_idtextanchor097"></a>

To complete this chapter, we assume that you have installed Microsoft Office and Outlook on your device. You can learn how to install Microsoft Office here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/install-applications?view=o365-worldwide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/setup/install-applications?view=o365-worldwide).

However, we will walk through the complete installation of the Outlook API.

You will require the following:

* Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer
* An OpenAI API key
* A code editor, such as PyCharm (recommended)
* A **Windows** operating system
* The latest Microsoft Office 365 apps (Outlook) installed on your device.

In the next section, you will learn how to install Microsoft Outlook and the **win32com** library. You will also learn how to pass email data from Outlook to the ChatGPT API for automatic email reply generation.

The code for the Outlook Email Reply Generator project can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter07%20ReplyTool](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter07%20ReplyTool)

## Passing Outlook Data to the ChatGPT API <a href="#_idtextanchor098" id="_idtextanchor098"></a>

To get started, we will first cover the essential steps to set up your development environment for building the Outlook email reply generator. Here, you will start by installing Microsoft Outlook on your computer and setting up an email account. Once you have all the libraries installed, we will show you how to use the **win32com** library to extract email data from Outlook and pass it to the ChatGPT API, to generate an automatic email reply.

Let’s set up your **PyCharm** project to build the Outlook email reply generator. To do this, open PyCharm and click on **Create New Project**. In the **New Project** dialog box, give your project the name **EmailReplyGenerator**. Keep the default location, and click on **Create** to create the new project. Once the project is created, you can create a new Python file called **app.py** and start writing the code to extract email data from Outlook, passing it to the ChatGPT API.

To complete the project setup, you will also need to install two Python libraries. You can install these libraries using the **pip** package manager. To get started, open Command Prompt or Terminal on your machine and type the following command to install both the libraries:

```
$pip install openai
$pip install pywin32
```

After installing these libraries, we can now proceed to the secure handling of the ChatGPT API key, which will enable us to authenticate ourselves when connecting to the AI. To do that, let’s create a new file in our project called **config.py**. As demonstrated in the previous projects, this file will securely store all API keys utilized for the project. You can now include an API token and the necessary libraries in the appropriate files, as shown here:

config.py

```
API_KEY = "<YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY>"
```

app.py

```
import openai
import win32com.client
import tkinter as tk
import config
openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
```

The **config.py** file securely stores the ChatGPT API key, which is imported into the **app.py** file. The API key is then used to establish a secure connection with the ChatGPT API through the **openai** library. Additionally, the **win32com.client** and **tkinter** libraries are imported to work with Outlook email data and create the graphical user interface, respectively.

With these steps, you can ensure that your project is properly set up, allowing you to proceed with launching the installed Outlook application on your device smoothly.

### Setting Up the Outlook Email <a href="#_idtextanchor099" id="_idtextanchor099"></a>

In this section, we will guide you through the process of setting up your Microsoft Outlook app. Microsoft Outlook is a widely used email client and personal information manager developed by Microsoft. It is part of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, which includes popular productivity tools such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. While Microsoft Outlook is commonly associated with Microsoft email services, it is important to note that Outlook can be used with any email account, regardless of the email provider. This means that users can leverage the power and features of Outlook even if they have an email account from providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, or any other email service.

To open and log in to your email account using Outlook installed on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Launch Microsoft Outlook**: Look for the Outlook application icon on your computer and double-click it to open the program.
2. **Set up a new account**: Upon opening Outlook for the first time, you will be able to log in to your email address. Simply type your email address and click on the **Connect** button to begin the setup process (see _Figure 7.1_).

![Figure 7.1: The Outlook Email Setup Window](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_1.jpg)

Figure 7.1: The Outlook Email Setup Window

1. **Follow the onscreen prompts**: Outlook will attempt to automatically configure the account settings based on your email address. You will see a confirmation message, and your email account will be added to Outlook.
2. **Access your email**: After the setup process is complete, you can access your email in the Outlook navigation pane. You will be able to view, send, receive, and manage your email messages within the Outlook application.

![Figure 7.2: The Outlook Desktop Interface](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_2.jpg)

Figure 7.2: The Outlook Desktop Interface

Upon reaching the Outlook application interface, you can now use the Outlook API to access and use **win32com.client** to manage your email data.

### Accessing Email Data with the win32com Client <a href="#_idtextanchor100" id="_idtextanchor100"></a>

In this section, we will guide you through the process of retrieving the last 10 email subjects from your **Outlook** account and displaying them in a user-friendly drop-down menu. You will learn how to use the **win32com** library to interact with **Outlook**, access email data, and populate the drop-down menu in a **graphical user interface** (**GUI**) created with Tkinter. This will allow users to conveniently select the email they want to generate a reply for.

To accomplish this, we will use the **last\_10\_emails()** function. Inside this function, we will utilize the **win32com.client** library. We will connect to the Outlook application and access the default email inbox folder. From there, we will retrieve the collection of email messages in the inbox:

```
def last_10_emails():
    outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").GetNamespace("MAPI")
    inbox = outlook.GetDefaultFolder(6)
    messages = inbox.Items
    emails = [messages.GetLast().Subject]
    email_number = 10
    for i in range(email_number):
        emails.append(messages.GetPrevious().Subject)
    return emails
```

First, we will use the **win32com.client.Dispatch()** function to create a connection to the Outlook application. This function takes a string argument, **Outlook.Application**, to specify the application we want to access. Then, we will use the **GetNamespace()** method with the **MAPI** argument to retrieve the messaging and collaboration services namespace within Outlook. This namespace provides access to various Outlook objects and folders.

By calling **GetDefaultFolder(6)**, we retrieve the default email **Inbox** folder. The **6** argument corresponds to the index of the **Inbox** folder within the Outlook namespace. This ensures that we access the correct folder. By assigning the result to the **inbox** variable, we now have a reference to the **Inbox** folder, which allows us to retrieve email messages and perform operations on them. **inbox.Items** retrieves the collection of items or email messages within the **Inbox** folder. This collection is assigned to the **messages** variable.

To retrieve the subject of the most recent email, **messages.GetLast().Subject** will be used. **GetLast()** returns the last email item in the collection, while **.Subject** retrieves the subject of that email. We can now wrap the email subject in a list to ensure it is a list containing a single subject. We can also define a variable called **email\_number**. It represents the number of previous emails that we want to retrieve subjects for.

In addition to the **GetList** method, you can get specific email items using the following **win32com** methods:

* **FindNext**: This method is used to retrieve the next email item in a collection of emails that match the specified search criteria
* **GetFirst**: With this method, you can retrieve the first email item from a collection of emails, enabling access to its contents or properties
* **GetNext**: Used in conjunction with **GetFirst**, this method retrieves the next email item in a collection, facilitating sequential access to all the emails within the collection
* **GetPrevious**: This method complements **GetFirst** and allows you to retrieve the email item that comes before the currently accessed item in a collection of emails, enabling sequential backward access to the emails

We can now iterate over a range of the previous 10 subjects of the previous emails. Within the loop, we use **GetPrevious().Subject** to access the subject of the email preceding the current one in the iteration. This method moves the pointer to the previous email in the collection, and **.Subject** retrieves its subject.

For each iteration, we append the retrieved subject to the emails list using the **append()** method. This builds up a list of email subjects for the previous emails, starting from the most recent and going back in time.

Once the loop completes, we have a list of 10 email subjects stored in the emails list. We can then return this list of email subjects from the **last\_10\_emails()** function, allowing it to be used in our Outlook email reply generator.

Now, we can focus on creating the user interface to display the email subjects and allow the user to select one to generate a reply. Let’s break down what each part of the following code does:

```
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Outlook Emails")
root.geometry("300x300")
email_subjects = last_10_emails()
selected_subject = tk.StringVar()
dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(root, selected_subject, *email_subjects)
dropdown.pack()
label = tk.Label(root, text="")
label.pack()
root.mainloop()
```

Firstly, we will initialize and configure the main graphical window for the application using the **tkinter** library.

**root = tk.Tk()** creates the main window object, which is commonly referred to as the root or the top-level window. This object represents the main window that will contain the user interface elements of our application.

Then, we can set the title of the window to **Outlook Emails**. This title will be displayed in the title bar of the window. We will also set the dimensions of the window to **300** pixels wide and **300** pixels tall. This determines the initial size of the window when it is first displayed on the screen.

After the window template is completed, we can initialize the variables that will be used to manage the email subjects in the user interface. The **last\_10\_emails()** function is used here to retrieve the list of email subjects. The function returns a list of the last 10 email subjects from the Outlook application into the **email\_subjects** variable.

The **selected\_subject** variable creates a **StringVar** object from the **tkinter** library. This object is a special variable type that can be associated with various GUI widgets. By creating a **StringVar** object, we have a variable that can hold a string value and be easily associated with GUI elements, such as buttons or drop-down menus. This allows us to track and manipulate the selected email subject within our application.

Then, we create a drop-down menu in the user interface to display the list of email subjects. The **OpenMenu** widget represents a drop-down menu where the user can select an option from a list. The **root** argument specifies that the drop-down menu should be placed within the main window of our application, while the **selected\_subject** argument specifies the variable that will be associated with the drop-down menu. It indicates the variable that will hold the currently selected email subject from the drop-down menu.

The **\*email\_subjects** argument uses the **\*** operator to unpack the **email\_subjects** list into individual items. This allows each email subject to be treated as a separate argument for the **OptionMenu** widget, providing the list of options for the drop-down menu.

We can then build a label widget and start the main event loop of the application. The **label** variable creates a label widget, used to display text or other information in the user interface. The text argument specifies the initial text to be displayed in the label, which is an empty string in this case. **label.pack()** packs the widgets within the main window.

Finally, **root.mainloop()** starts the main event loop. This method is responsible for handling user events, such as mouse clicks or button presses, and updating the GUI accordingly. The program will remain in this loop until the user closes the application window, ensuring that the application remains responsive and interactive.

To test the application, let’s imagine that we are a software engineer that received 10 work emails from their colleagues.

Now, you can click on the **Run** button in **PyCharm** to execute the current version of your Outlook email reply generator. Once the code is running, a window titled **Outlook Emails** will appear. This window contains a drop-down menu listing the last 10 email subjects from the **Outlook** application, as shown in _Figure 7.3_:

![Figure 7.3: The Email Reply Generator Last 10 Emails Drop-Down Menu](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_3.jpg)

Figure 7.3: The Email Reply Generator Last 10 Emails Drop-Down Menu

You can now select an email subject from the drop-down menu. Upon selection, the text of the selected email subject will be stored in the **selected\_subject** variable and displayed inside the drop-down menu button (see _Figure 7.4_).

![Figure 7.4: A Selected Email Subject Inside the Drop-Down Menu Button](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_4.jpg)

Figure 7.4: A Selected Email Subject Inside the Drop-Down Menu Button

Those are the essential steps to set up the development environment to build the Outlook email reply generator. We went through extracting email data from Outlook using the **win32com** library and passing it to the ChatGPT API. You also learned how to access and display email data using the **win32com** and **tkinter** libraries to create a GUI.

In the next section, you will complete your Outlook email reply generator by using the ChatGPT API to generate AI replies to a specific email selected by the user. We will also build the corresponding button for users to access that functionality from the desktop application.

### Generating automatic email replies <a href="#_idtextanchor101" id="_idtextanchor101"></a>

Now, let’s delve into the implementation of key functionality in our application to generate automatic replies to Outlook emails. We will go through the process of building the final portion of our app that utilizes the Outlook API to retrieve email data, leveraging the power of the ChatGPT API to generate original replies based on the data obtained in the previous section. Here, you will learn how to seamlessly integrate the ChatGPT API into your Outlook applications.

We will build the **reply()** function, which serves as the core component responsible for generating email replies. Within this function, you will retrieve the selected email subject from the user interface and use it to fetch the corresponding email content from Outlook. We will demonstrate how to leverage the ChatGPT API to generate AI-powered responses based on the email content. Through this process, you will gain hands-on experience in passing data between ChatGPT and Outlook.

You can include the **reply()** function just above the **root.mainloop()** inside your **app.py** file. Note that the **root.mainloop()** function call should always be the last line of the code in a **tkinter** application. This is because **root.mainloop()** initiates the main event loop, which is responsible for handling user events and updating the GUI:

```
def reply():
    email = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").        GetNamespace("MAPI").\
        GetDefaultFolder(6).Items.Item(selected_subject.get())
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        max_tokens=1024,
        n=1,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "You are a professional email                 writer"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Create a reply to this                 email:\n {email.Body}"}
        ]
    )
    reply = email.Reply()
    reply.Body = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    reply.Display()
    return
```

Firstly, we can retrieve the selected email content from the Outlook application using the **win32com** library. We will access the Outlook application through the **Dispatch** method. From there, we retrieve the **Inbox** email folder using the **GetDefaultFolder(6)** and retrieve the specific email item, based on the subject obtained from **selected\_subject**. The resulting **email** object represents the email with the subject specified by the user, and it can be further used to generate a reply or access other email properties.

Then, we can make use of the ChatGPT API to generate a response to an email. We will call the **openai.ChatCompletion.create()** method and provide several parameters to generate a response. The **max\_tokens** parameter limits the length of the generated email reply to 1,024 tokens. By adjusting this parameter, you can increase or decrease the number of tokens to achieve the desired length for your email reply.

As you can see here, we are using the most advanced ChatGPT model **GPT-4**. This model is trained on significantly more data compared to the GPT-3 and is more accurate, factual, and relievable in solving complex tasks, which also include personalized email copywriting.

The **openai.ChatCompletion.create()** method is a crucial part of the implementation, as it leverages the ChatGPT API to generate automatic email replies. The **prompt** parameter is particularly significant, as it sets the initial input given to the language model. In this case, the prompt includes the email content obtained from Outlook, which serves as the context to generate the reply.

To improve the quality and diversity of responses, developers can experiment with different prompts. By crafting more specific or varied prompts, the model’s output can be guided to meet specific criteria or generate replies tailored to different contexts. Here are a few alternatives:

* **Contextual prompt**: “You received an email from a colleague requesting your availability for a meeting. Compose a polite and concise reply confirming your attendance.”

In this prompt, the model is explicitly instructed to respond to a meeting request from a colleague. By providing a specific scenario and asking for a “polite and concise” reply, the generated response is more likely to align with the desired context and tone.

* **Emotion-infused prompt**: “You just received an email from a close friend sharing some exciting news. Draft a warm and enthusiastic reply to congratulate them and share your thoughts.”

By infusing the prompt with emotional keywords such as “exciting news,” “warm,” and “enthusiastic,” the model is encouraged to produce a response that conveys a sense of joy and support, making it sound more authentic and human-like.

* **Formal business prompt**: “As a customer service representative, you received an email from a dissatisfied customer regarding a recent product issue. Craft a professional and empathetic response to address their concerns and offer a solution.”

Here, the prompt sets a formal business context, instructing the model to respond as a customer service representative dealing with a dissatisfied customer. Using the term “empathetic” emphasizes the importance of a compassionate and helpful reply, which can lead to a more realistic and considerate response.

* **Personalized prompt**: “Your colleague sent you an email with some exciting updates about their recent vacation. Reply with your genuine excitement, ask follow-up questions, and share a bit about what’s been happening in your life too.”

This prompt encourages a more personalized response, as it specifies that the reply should express genuine excitement and involve asking follow-up questions. By emphasizing the reciprocity of sharing information about the sender’s life, the generated reply is likely to feel more natural and akin to a real conversation.

* **Instructional prompt**: “You received an email from a colleague asking for detailed instructions on how to use a new software tool. Provide a step-by-step guide with clear explanations and visual aids where necessary.”

In this case, the prompt sets a clear instruction for the model to generate a reply containing detailed instructions. The use of terms such as “step-by-step guide” and “clear explanations” directs the model toward providing more informative and structured responses.

The subject and email content play vital roles in generating the reply. The selected email subject serves as a key identifier for the email that the user wants to respond to. Once the email is identified, its content **body** is used as the context to generate the reply. By utilizing both the subject and email content, the reply function ensures that the response generated by ChatGPT is relevant and contextual. The email content provides essential information about the sender’s query or message, and the model uses this information to craft a coherent and appropriate reply.

Sharing mail content with ChatGPT, or any external API for that matter, raises valid security concerns. This can be prevented through appropriate privacy policies and user consent mechanisms. Furthermore, using secure communication protocols (for example, HTTPS) and working with reputable and trusted API providers, such as OpenAI, can help safeguard data during transmission and processing.

After the ChatGPT API response is obtained, we can prepare the email reply by creating a reply object using **email.Reply()**. The reply’s body text is then assigned the extracted response text obtained from the ChatGPT JSON **response** parameter. This ensures that the AI-generated content is included in the reply.

The **reply.Display()** function is then called to display the reply in a separate window, allowing the user to review and potentially make any necessary edits before sending it. The return statement signifies the end of the **reply()** function and returns control to the main program, where we will build the **Reply** button:

<pre><code><strong>button = tk.Button(root, text="Generate Reply",
</strong><strong>                   command=reply)
</strong><strong>button.pack()
</strong>root.mainloop()
</code></pre>

The button is associated with the root window and displays the text **Generate Reply** as its label. The command parameter specifies that the previously build **reply()** function should be executed when the button is clicked. By calling **button.pack()**, the button is packed within the window, allowing it to be displayed to the user. This is how we can set up a user interface element that triggers the **reply()** function when clicked, enabling the generation of an email reply in response to user interaction.

You can now start your Outlook email reply generator app with a single click on the **Run** button in PyCharm. Once you do that, there will be a new button called **Generate Reply** displayed on your application window (see _Figure 7.5_).

![Figure 7.5: The Generate Reply Button](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_5.jpg)

Figure 7.5: The Generate Reply Button

You can now select an email from the drop-down menu and click the **Generate Reply** button. The button will instantly activate the **reply()** function, passing the content of the email to the ChatGPT API and asking it to generate a reply based on that content. This process will happen in the background, and within a few seconds, your app will launch the **Outlook reply window**. As you can see in _Figure 7.6_, the reply window will be populated with the generated ChatGPT reply to the selected email.

![Figure 7.6: An Email Reply Generated by ChatGPT](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_07\_6.jpg)

Figure 7.6: An Email Reply Generated by ChatGPT

To verify that the generated reply is relevant, you can check the content of the selected email and the ChatGPT reply, such as the following:

* **Selected email content**
* _Hi Martin,_

_I have an exciting new feature request for you. Our users have been asking for a personalized dashboard that provides an overview of their account activity and statistics._

_I would appreciate it if you could start working on this feature and provide an estimate for the development effort required._

* **GPT-4 API reply**:

_Dear Bill,_

_Thank you for your email and for presenting such an exciting new feature request._

_A personalized dashboard is indeed a wonderful addition that would significantly enhance the user experience. I understand the importance of a tool that could provide our users with a comprehensive overview of their account activity and statistics._

_I will immediately commence with the preliminary work to evaluate the possibilities. This constitutes understanding user needs in depth, defining the necessary features, and analyzing the scope of work._

_By considering the complexity and range of this feature, I anticipate the initial estimate to be concluded within a week’s time. This will assist me in providing an accurate estimate of the development effort required._

_I look forward to the potential positive impact this new feature could bring to our user experience. Thank you for entrusting this task to me._

_Best regards,_

_Martin_

In addition to generating a relevant reply, your application empowers the user to edit the AI-generated response before sending it. This functionality also allows them to address any minor imperfections or make adjustments to the reply, ensuring a polished final email. By providing the option to review and modify the AI-generated reply, the user has greater control over the content and can tailor it to their specific needs before sending the email.

This concludes our implementation of generating automatic email replies using Outlook and the ChatGPT API. You can now retrieve email data from Outlook, use the ChatGPT API to generate AI-powered responses, and integrate this functionality into an Outlook application, allowing users to review and modify the generated replies before sending them.

## Summary <a href="#_idtextanchor102" id="_idtextanchor102"></a>

In this chapter, we covered the complete development of the Outlook email reply generator using Outlook and ChatGPT API with the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model. We learned how to retrieve email data from Outlook using the **win32com** library and display the email subjects in a drop-down menu using the **tkinter** library. We wrote the code to connect to the Outlook application, access the default email inbox folder, and retrieve the last 10 email subjects. We also covered the creation of the user interface, including the main window, the drop-down menu, and a label.

We also learned the process of building the **reply()** function, which retrieved email data from Outlook, generated AI-powered responses using the ChatGPT API, and displayed the generated reply in a separate window for reviewing and editing. The chapter also explained how to integrate the **reply()** function into the application and how to create a button in the user interface that triggers the **reply()** function. We also tested the application by selecting an email subject from the drop-down menu and generating an AI reply email, using the ChatGPT API.

In [_Chapter 8_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-ai-applications/9781805127567/B21110\_08.xhtml#\_idTextAnchor103), you will learn how to integrate ChatGPT API with one of the most popular app development Python frameworks, **PyQT**. You will build an essay generation tool that will be able to create essays on any topic. Here, we will move one step further and show you how to control the API tokens directly from the application’s frontend. This will allow you to specify the length of the responses and, consequently, the generated essay received from the ChatGPT API.
