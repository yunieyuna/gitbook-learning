In the upcoming sections, you will embark on the journey of building a desktop application using PyQt. You will dive into the intricacies of GUI design and learn how to leverage PyQt’s powerful features to develop a visually appealing and interactive desktop application.

## Building a Desktop Application with PyQT <a href="#_idtextanchor106" id="_idtextanchor106"></a>

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience in creating various components of the PyQt application’s user interface, such as windows, labels, buttons, text fields, and drop-down menus. Here, you will set up the PyCharm project, install the **PyQt6** and **docx** libraries, and build your desktop application frontend.

First, let’s discuss what the PyQt library is, and how it differs from the rest of the Python application development tools, such as Tkinter (see _Table 8.1_). PyQt is a powerful Python framework widely used for creating desktop applications with rich **graphical user interfaces** (**GUIs**). It provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools, classes, and functionalities to design and build intuitive and visually appealing applications. PyQt is a wrapper around the popular **Qt** framework, offering seamless integration of Qt’s extensive libraries and widgets into Python.

Table 8.1: Comparison between PyQt and Tkinter

PyQt is a Python framework, unlike **tkinter**, which is Python’s standard library for creating GUIs using the Tk toolkit. PyQt offers a more extensive range of widgets and a highly customizable appearance. It also provides a more modern and aesthetically appealing look for GUIs. Now that you know what PyQt is, we can set up your PyCharm project and install this outstanding Python desktop app framework.

### Setting Up the Essay Generation Tool Project <a href="#_idtextanchor107" id="_idtextanchor107"></a>

Let’s first configure your PyCharm project by following the steps we are already familiar with. You can begin by launching PyCharm and selecting **Create New Project**. In the **New Project** dialog box, assign the name **EssayGenerationTool** to your project. You can maintain the default location and click on **Create** to establish the new project. Once the project is set up, you can create a Python file named **app.py** where the main code for the Essay Generation Tool is going to live.

To finalize the project setup, you will require the installation of several Python libraries. You can use the **pip** package manager to install these libraries. To commence, open a terminal in PyCharm and enter the following command to install all the necessary libraries:

```
pip install PyQt6
pip install openai
pip install python-docx
```

Additionally, let’s set up the necessary API key from OpenAI by creating the **config.py** module. As we have seen in previous projects, this file will serve as a secure storage location for all the API keys used in our project. Make sure that you have the **config.py** file located in the same directory as the code. However, it is important to note that you should avoid pushing this file to a Git repository to maintain its confidentiality and prevent exposing the API key. With the API token securely stored, you can proceed to include it in the relevant files alongside the necessary libraries, as demonstrated in the following code snippet:

config.py

```
API_KEY = "<YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY>"
```

app.py

```
import sys
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QLabel, QLineEdit, QPushButton, QTextEdit, QComboBox
import openai
import docx
import config
openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
```

Inside the **app.py** file, we can import several libraries to create our desktop application. The specific classes imported from **PyQt6** represent different GUI components such as the application window, labels, text fields, buttons, and drop-down menus. The **docx** module is also imported to handle the export of our AI-generated essays to a Microsoft Word document.

### Building the Application GUI with PyQt <a href="#_idtextanchor108" id="_idtextanchor108"></a>

In this section, we will explore the process of creating a PyQt application. We will set up the foundation for the essay generation application using the PyQt6 library. The application user interface that you will build consists of various widgets such as labels, input fields, a text area, and buttons.

To begin our journey in creating a PyQt application for generating essays, we will start by creating the initial app window and setting up the application launch logic. As mentioned earlier, our application will use an **object-oriented design** (**OOP**) by encapsulating related data and functionality within the **EssayGenerator** class.

Using object-oriented design with PyQt is beneficial because PyQt is built upon the Qt framework, which itself is designed with object-oriented principles. By aligning our code with the underlying framework, we can leverage the full power and flexibility of PyQt. By encapsulating the app functionality in a class, we can easily manage and maintain our application. This promotes code reusability and extensibility, as classes can be inherited, modified, and extended as needed. The **EssayGenerator** class will be derived from the **QWidget** class, which is a base class for all user interface objects in PyQt:

```
class EssayGenerator(Qwidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.initUI()
    def initUI(self):
        self.setWindowTitle("Essay Generator")
        self.setGeometry (300, 300, 1200, 800)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = Qapplication(sys.argv)
    ex = EssayGenerator()
    ex.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())
```

The use of the **QWidget** class as a base class in the **EssayGenerator** class allows us to adopt all **QWidget** features in the GUI of our application. **QWidget** is a fundamental class in PyQt that provides functionality for creating windows, handling events, and managing layouts. While there are other alternative base classes available in PyQt, such as **QMainWindow** for more complex applications or **QDialog** for custom dialog boxes, **QWidget** is chosen here because it serves as a versatile foundation for most user interface elements and provides the necessary features for creating a basic window in our Essay Generation application.

The **EssayGenerator** class is a specialized type of widget that can be used to create a GUI element. Inside the class, we have the **\_\_init\_\_** method, which is a special method in Python known as a **Constructor**. It gets executed when an object of the class is created. Within the **\_\_init\_\_** method of the **EssayGenerator** class, we use the **super()** keyword to call the **\_\_init\_\_** method of the parent class, **QWidget**, and initialize it. This ensures that the necessary setup from the parent class is performed before any additional initialization specific to the **EssayGenerator** class.

Then the **initUI()** method is responsible for setting up the user interface and other elements of the application, such as the window title, size, and position. It sets the window title of the application to **Essay Generator** using the built-in **setWindowTitle** method and specifies the position and size of the window on the screen, where the numbers represent the **x** and **y** coordinates of the top-left corner of the window, followed by its width and height, respectively.

By calling **super().\_\_init\_\_()** and **self.initUI()**, we ensure that the application is properly initialized and the main application window is launched once we run it. This approach follows the principle of inheritance, where the **EssayGenerator** child class inherits and extends the functionality of the parent class, **QWidget**, resulting in a fully functional and customized widget for our application.

In Python, it is common to use the **\_\_name\_\_ == '\_\_main\_\_'** condition to ensure that the subsequent code is only executed when the script is run as the main module. If it is, the code proceeds to create an instance of the **QApplication** class, which manages the application’s control flow.

The **ex** object is created from the **EssayGenerator** class to display the application window, and finally, **sys.exit(app.exec())** starts the event loop of the application, ensuring that the program remains active until the user closes the window or exits the application. This allows us to execute the application when the script is run directly. You can easily verify that a single click on the **Run** button in PyCharm results in the display of the main application window, as shown in _Figure 8.1_.

![Figure 8.1: Essay Generator Tool Window](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_08\_2.jpg)

Figure 8.1: Essay Generator Tool Window

Now that we have built the application window, we can start adding the core elements of our essay generator tool. Those are as follows:

* **Topic Input**: The essay generator requires a mechanism for users to input the topic or subject of the essay. This can be done through a text input field.
* **Essay Output**: Once the generation algorithm produces the essay content, it needs to be displayed to the user. This can be achieved through a text area where the generated essay is presented.
* **Saving Functionality**: Providing an option for users to save the generated essay is often useful. This can involve saving the essay to a file, such as a Word document, or providing the ability to copy the text to the clipboard.

Those core elements can be easily included inside the **initUI()** function, which holds all elements shown in our application:

```
def initUI(self):
    self.setWindowTitle("Essay Generator")
    self.setGeometry(300, 300, 1200, 800)
    topic_label = QLabel('Enter the topic:', self)
    topic_label.move(20, 40)
    self.topic_input = QLineEdit(self)
    self.topic_input.move(20, 100)
    self.topic_input.resize(1000, 30)
    self.essay_output = QTextEdit(self)
    self.essay_output.move(20, 150)
    self.essay_output.resize(1100, 500)
    generate_button = QPushButton("Generate Essay", self)
    generate_button.move(1050, 100)
    generate_button.clicked.connect(self.generate_essay)
    save_button = QPushButton("Save", self)
    save_button.move(20, 665)
    save_button.clicked.connect(self.save_essay)
```

Before creating the essay topic input field, we can instantiate a **QLabel** object called **topic\_label**. This label will be positioned above the **topic\_input** field. The purpose of the label is to instruct the user on the purpose of the text field below. We then use the **move()** method to position the label at coordinates **(20, 40)** within the application window.

Next, we create a **QLineEdit** object named **topic\_input** as the input field for the topic. Here, we can use the **move()** method again to position the input field below the label at coordinates **(20, 100)**. Additionally, we use the **resize()** method to set the dimensions of the input field. This ensures that the input field has an appropriate size for user input.

Then we can define the **essay\_output** attribute as an instance of the **QTextEdit** class, which represents a multi-line text editing widget. We again use the **move()** and **resize()** built-in methods to place the essay output filed under the topic input text field. The **essay\_output** text area is used so that the generated essay text can be displayed. Users can now easily read and interact with the essay output, enhancing the usability and functionality of the application.

Important Note

In Python, the **self** keyword is a convention used to refer to the instance of a class within the class itself. It is not a reserved keyword but a commonly used name for the first parameter of instance methods in a class. When defining methods within a class, including the **self** parameter as the first parameter allows you to access and modify the instance variables and methods of that class.

Finally, we create two buttons for the essay generator application: the **Generate Essay** button and a **Save** button. For both buttons, we can use the **QPushButton** class, which provides a clickable button element that users can interact with by clicking or pressing it. Here, it is essential to use the **clicked.connect()** method, which connects the button’s **clicked** signal to a method, allowing the method to be called when the button is clicked.

Once the user clicks the **Generate Essay** button, our app will automatically call the **generate\_essay()** function. This method will be responsible for building a connection with the ChatGPT API and displaying the response, or the generated essay, inside our **essay\_output** text field. Similarly, once the essay is generated, the user will be able to click on the **Save** button. This action will activate the **save\_essay()** function, where we will later use the **docx** library to save our essay in a Word document.

Even though **save\_essay()** and **generate\_essay()** are not implemented yet, we can initialize them for the purpose of testing our application. Both methods should be placed inside the **EssayGeneration** class, but outside the **initUI()** method. It is also a good practice to place the function definitions above the main Python function to avoid any unexpected errors:

<pre><code>def initUI(self):
    ...
    ..
    .
<strong>def generate_essay(self):
</strong><strong>    pass
</strong><strong>def save_essay(self):
</strong><strong>    pass
</strong></code></pre>

Currently, the method consists of a **pass** statement, which is a placeholder statement in Python that does nothing. This is used to indicate that the method does not have any implementation yet.

When you execute your application again, you will observe that all the text fields and buttons are presented within the application window (see _Figure 8.2_).

![Figure 8.2: Essay Generator Text Fields and Buttons](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_08\_3.jpg)

Figure 8.2: Essay Generator Text Fields and Buttons

This is how you can create a basic PyQt application. Now you know how to build the application window, initialize the user interface elements, and create the core elements of the essay generator tool, such as the topic input field, essay output text area, and buttons for generating and saving essays.

Since both the **save\_essay()** and **generate\_essay()** methods contain the placeholder **pass** keyword, clicking the buttons will not perform any substantial actions at this point. We would need to implement the necessary functionality within the respective methods to achieve the desired behavior when the buttons are clicked. You will learn how to build those methods in the upcoming section.

## Creating Essay Generation Methods with the ChatGPT API <a href="#_idtextanchor109" id="_idtextanchor109"></a>

In this section, we will dive into the implementation of the key functions within the essay generator application. These functions are responsible for generating the essay based on user input and saving the generated essay to a file. By understanding the code, you will be able to grasp the inner workings of the application and gain insight into how the essay generation and saving processes are accomplished.

We will begin by exploring the **generate\_essay()** function. This function will retrieve the topic entered by the user from the input field. It will then set the engine type for the OpenAI API, create a prompt using the topic, and make a request to the OpenAI API for essay generation. The response received from the API will contain the generated essay, which will be extracted and displayed in the essay output area of the application. To add that functionality, simply remove the **pass** placeholder and follow this code:

```
def generate_essay(self):
    topic = self.topic_input.text()
    tokens = 500
    engine = "gpt-4"
    prompt = f"Write an {tokens/1.5} words essay on the following         topic: {topic} \n\n"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": "You are a professional                     essay writer."},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
            ],
            max_tokens=tokens
        )
        essay = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

Here, we retrieve the topic entered by the user from the **topic\_input** **QLineEdit** widget and assign it to the topic variable using the **text()** method. This captures the user’s chosen topic for the essay. For now, we can define the **tokens** variable and set it to **500**. This indicates the desired length of the generated essay. We will modify this value later by adding a drop-down menu with different token sizes to generate essays of different lengths.

We can also specify the engine used for the OpenAI API to be **text-davinci-003**, which will generate the essay. You can adjust this value to utilize different language models or versions based on your requirements. We can also create the **prompt** variable, which is a string containing the prompt for essay generation.

It is constructed by concatenating the **Write an {tokens/1.5} essay on the following topic:** text, where the **tokens/1.5** variable specifies how many words our essay should be. We need to divide the token number by 1.5, as 1 word in English represents about 1.5 tokens according to OpenAI. After specifying the instructions, we can pass the **topic** variable to the prompt. This prompt serves as the initial input for the essay generation process and provides context for the generated essay.

Once all variables are defined, we make a request to the ChatGPT API with the specified engine, prompt, and the maximum number of tokens (in this case, 500). The API processes the prompt and generates a response, which is stored in the **response** variable. From the response, we extract the generated essay by accessing the **text** attribute of the first choice. This represents the generated text of the essay. Finally, we can pass the AI response to the **essay\_output()** function, displaying it in the user interface for the user to read and interact with.

Moving on, we will examine the **save\_essay()** function. This function will retrieve the topic and the generated essay. It will utilize the **docx** library to create a new Word document and add the final essay to the document. The document will then be saved with the filename based on the provided topic, resulting in a Word document that contains the generated essay. After removing the **pass** keyword, you can implement the described functionality using the following code snippet:

```
def save_essay(self):
    topic = self.topic_input.text()
    final_text = self.essay_output.toPlainText()
    document = docx.Document()
    document.add_paragraph(final_text)
    document.save(topic + ".docx")
```

Here, we retrieve the text entered in the **topic\_input** widget and assign it to the **topic** variable using the **text()** method. This captures the topic entered by the user, which will be used as the filename for the saved essay. Next, we use the **toPlainText()** method on the **essay\_output** widget to retrieve the generated essay text and assign it to the **final\_text** variable. This ensures that the user can edit the ChatGPT-generated essay before saving it. By capturing the topic and the final text, we are now equipped to proceed with the necessary steps to save the essay to a file.

We can now use the **docx** library to create a new Word document by calling **docx.Document()**, which initializes an empty document. We then add a paragraph to the document by using the **add\_paragraph()** method and passing in the **final\_text** variable, which contains the generated essay text. This adds the generated essay as a paragraph to the document. We can now save the document by calling **document.save()** and providing a filename constructed by concatenating the **topic** variable, which represents the topic entered by the user. This saves the document as a Word file with the specified filename.

You can now test your essay generator by running the code in PyCharm and generating an essay following these steps (see _Figure 8.3_):

1. Write an essay topic of your choice in the **Topic Input** field. For this example, I have chosen the topic **Ancient Egypt**.
2. Perform a single click on the **Generate Essay** button. The app will reach ChatGPT API and within a few seconds you will have your essay displayed inside the **Essay Output** field.
3. You can edit the essay generated by the artificial intelligence before saving it.
4. Perform a single click on the **Save** button. This action will save the edited essay to a Word document utilizing the **save\_essay()** method. The Word document will be saved in the root directory of your project.

![Figure 8.3: Essay Generator Creating an “Ancient Egypt” Essay](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_08\_4.jpg)

Figure 8.3: Essay Generator Creating an “Ancient Egypt” Essay

Once the essay has been saved to a Word document, you can reshare it with your peers, submit it as a school assignment or use any Word styling options on it.

This section discussed the implementation of key functions in our essay generator application using the ChatGPT API. We built the **generate\_essay()** method, which retrieved the user’s topic input and sent a request to the ChatGPT API to generate an AI essay. We also developed the **save\_essay()** method, which saved the generated essay in a Word document.

In the next section, we will introduce additional functionality to the essay generator application. Specifically, we will allow the user to change the number of AI tokens used for generating the essay.

## Controlling the ChatGPT API Tokens <a href="#_idtextanchor110" id="_idtextanchor110"></a>

In this section, we will explore how to enhance the functionality of the essay generator application by allowing users to have control over the number of tokens used when communicating with ChatGPT. By enabling this feature, users will be able to generate essays of different lengths, tailored to their specific needs or preferences. Currently, our application has a fixed value of 500 tokens, but we will modify it to include a drop-down menu that provides different options for token sizes.

To implement this functionality, we will make use of a drop-down menu that presents users with a selection of token length options. By selecting a specific value from the dropdown, users can indicate their desired length for the generated essay. We will integrate this feature seamlessly into the existing application, empowering users to customize their essay-generation experience.

Let’s delve into the code snippet that will enable users to control the token length. You can add that code inside the **initUI()** methods, just under the **essay\_output** resizing:

```
    def initUI(self):
        self.setWindowTitle("Essay Generator")
        self.setGeometry(300, 300, 1200, 800)
        topic_label = QLabel('Enter the topic:', self)
        topic_label.move(20, 40)
        self.topic_input = QLineEdit(self)
        self.topic_input.move(20, 100)
        self.topic_input.resize(1000, 30)
        self.essay_output = QTextEdit(self)
        self.essay_output.move(20, 150)
        self.essay_output.resize(1100, 500)
        length_label = QLabel('Select Essay Length:', self)
        length_label.move(327, 40)
        self.length_dropdown = QComboBox(self)
        self.length_dropdown.move(320, 60)
        self.length_dropdown.addItems(["500", "1000", "2000", "3000",
            "4000"])
        generate_button = QPushButton("Generate Essay", self)
        generate_button.move(1050, 100)
        generate_button.clicked.connect(self.generate_essay)
        save_button = QPushButton("Save", self)
        save_button.move(20, 665)
        save_button.clicked.connect(self.save_essay)
```

The preceding code introduces **QLabel**, **length\_label**, which serves as a visual indication of the purpose of the drop-down menu. It displays the text **Select Essay Length** to inform users about the functionality.

Next, we create **QcomboBox**, **length\_dropdown**, which provides users with a drop-down menu to choose the desired token length. It is positioned below **length\_label** using the **move()** method. The **addItems()** function is then used to populate the drop-down menu with a list of token length options, ranging from **500** to **4000** tokens. Users can select their preferred length from this list.

The final step is to implement the functionality that allows users to control the number of tokens used when generating the essay. We need to modify the **generate\_essay()** function. The modified code should be the following:

<pre><code>def generate_essay(self):
    topic = self.topic_input.text()
<strong>    length = int(self.length_dropdown.currentText())
</strong>    engine = "gpt-4"
    prompt = f"Write an {tokens/1.5} words essay on the following         topic: {topic} \n\n"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": "You are a professional                     essay writer."},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"{prompt}"}
            ],
            max_tokens=tokens
        )
        essay = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
</code></pre>

In the modified code, the **length** variable is updated to retrieve the selected token length from the **length\_dropdown** drop-down menu. The **currentText()** method is used to obtain the currently selected option as a string, which is then converted into an integer using the **int()** function. This allows the chosen token length to be assigned to the length variable dynamically.

By making this modification, the **generate\_essay()** function will utilize the user-selected token length when making the request to the ChatGPT API for essay generation. This ensures that the generated essay will have the desired length specified by the user through the drop-down menu.

We can now click on the **Run** button in PyCharm and verify that drop-down menu works properly. As shown in _Figure 8.4_, a click on the drop-down menu will show users all options specified by the **addItems()** function.

Figure 8.4: Controlling the Essay Length

The user will be able to choose a token amount between **500** and **4000**. Now you can select the **4000** tokens option, resulting in a longer length for the generated essay. We can follow the steps from our previous example and verify that the ChatGPT API generates a longer essay for “**Ancient Egypt**” when the number of tokens is increased from **500** to **4000**.

This is how you can enhance the functionality of an essay generator application by allowing users to control the number of tokens used when communicating with ChatGPT. By selecting a specific value from the drop-down menu, users can now indicate their desired length for the generated essay. We achieved that by using the **QComboBox** class to create the drop-down menu itself. The modified **generate\_essay()** method retrieved the selected token length from the drop-down menu and dynamically assigned it to the **length** variable.

## Summary <a href="#_idtextanchor111" id="_idtextanchor111"></a>

In this chapter, you learned how to build a desktop application with PyQt and enhance its functionality by integrating the ChatGPT API for essay generation. We discussed the basics of PyQt and its advantages over other Python GUI development tools. We used that framework to create the application’s GUI components, such as windows, labels, input fields, text areas, and buttons.

The chapter also delved into the implementation of the essay generation functionality using the ChatGPT API. The main method discussed was **generate\_essay()**, which took the user’s chosen topic, set the engine type, created a prompt using the topic, and sent a request to the API to generate the essay. The generated essay was then displayed in the application’s output area. You also learned how to build the **save\_essay()** function, which used the **docx** library to save the generated essay as a Word document.

Furthermore, the chapter explored how to enhance the application by allowing users to control the length of the generated essay. It introduced a drop-down menu implemented with **QLabel** and **QComboBox** classes, allowing users to select different token sizes. The modified **generate\_essay()** function retrieved the selected token length from the drop-down menu and adjusted the length of the generated essay accordingly.

In [_Chapter 9_](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-ai-applications/9781805127567/B21110\_09.xhtml#\_idTextAnchor112), called _Integrating ChatGPT and DALL-E API: Build End-to-End PowerPoint Presentation Generator_, you will learn how to integrate two AI APIs, **ChatGPT** and **DALL-E**, to build an end-to-end **PowerPoint** presentation generator. You will be introduced to the DALL-E API and learn about decoding JSON responses from the API. The chapter will also cover the PowerPoint Python framework and demonstrate how to generate AI art using the DALL-E API, enabling you to create PowerPoint slides and images.
