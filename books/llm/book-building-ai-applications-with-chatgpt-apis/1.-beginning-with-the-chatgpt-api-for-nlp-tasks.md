The code examples from this chapter can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter01%20ChatGPTResponse](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter01%20ChatGPTResponse).

## The ChatGPT Revolution <a href="#_idtextanchor017" id="_idtextanchor017"></a>

ChatGPT is an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI, and it has made a significant impact on the field of **natural language processing** (**NLP**). The model is based on the transformer architecture, and it has been trained on a massive dataset of diverse texts, including books, articles, and web pages.

One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate text that is coherent and contextually appropriate. In contrast to earlier NLP models, ChatGPT possesses a more extensive comprehension of language, and it can generate text that is similar in style and structure to human-generated text. This feature has made ChatGPT a valuable tool for various applications, including conversational AI and content creation.

ChatGPT has also made significant progress in the field of conversational AI, where it has been used to develop chatbots that can interact with humans naturally. With its ability to understand context and generate text that is similar in style to human-generated text, ChatGPT has become a go-to tool for developing conversational AI.

The emergence of **large language models** (**LLMs**) such as GPT-3 has revolutionized the landscape of chatbots. Prior to LLMs, chatbots were limited in their capabilities, relying on rule-based systems with predefined responses. These chatbots lacked contextual understanding and struggled to engage in meaningful conversations. However, with LLM-based chatbots, there has been a significant transformation. These models comprehend complex queries, generate coherent and nuanced responses, and possess a broader knowledge base. They exhibit improved contextual understanding, learn from user interactions, and continually enhance their performance. LLM-based chatbots have elevated the user experience by providing more natural and personalized interactions, showcasing the remarkable advancements in chatbot technology.

ChatGPT has a long and successful history in the field of NLP. The model has undergone several advancements over the years, including the following:

* GPT-1 (2018): Had 117 million parameters and was trained on a diverse set of web pages. It demonstrated impressive results in various NLP tasks, including question-answering, sentiment analysis, and language translation.
* GPT-2 (2019): Had 1.5 billion parameters and was trained on over 8 million web pages. It showed remarkable progress in language understanding and generation and became a widely used tool for various NLP applications.
* GPT-3 (2020): Had a record-breaking 175 billion parameters and set a new benchmark for language understanding and generation. It was used for various applications, including chatbots, language translation, and content creation.
* GPT-3.5: The latest version of the model, released after continued refinement and improvement by OpenAI.

GPT-4 can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to its broader general knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Developers can harness the power of GPT models without requiring them to train their own models from scratch. This can save a lot of time and resources, especially for smaller teams or individual developers.

In the next section, you will learn how to use ChatGPT from the web. You will learn how to create an OpenAI account and explore the ChatGPT web interface.

## Using ChatGPT from the Web <a href="#_idtextanchor018" id="_idtextanchor018"></a>

Interacting with ChatGPT via the OpenAI website is incredibly straightforward. OpenAI provides a web-based interface that can be found at [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/), enabling users to engage with the model without any prior coding knowledge or setup required. Once you visit the website, you can begin entering your questions or prompts, and the model will produce its best possible answer or generated text.

![Figure 1.3: ChatGPT Following Conversational Context](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.03\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.3: ChatGPT Following Conversational Context

In addition to that, ChatGPT allows users to easily record the history of their interactions with the model. Users’ chat logs are automatically saved, which can later be accessed from the left sidebar for reference or analysis. This feature is especially useful for researchers or individuals who want to keep track of their conversations with the model and evaluate its performance over time. The chat logs can also be used to train other models or compare the performance of different models. You are now able to distinguish and use the advancements of different ChatGPT models. You can also use ChatGPT from the web, including creating an account and generating API keys. The ChatGPT API is flexible, customizable, and can save developers time and resources, making it an ideal choice for chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content generation. In the next section, you will learn how to access the ChatGPT API easily using Python.

## Getting Started with the ChatGPT API <a href="#_idtextanchor023" id="_idtextanchor023"></a>

The **ChatGPT API** is an application programming interface developed by OpenAI that allows developers to interact with **Generative Pre-trained Transformer** (**GPT**) models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This API provides an easy-to-use interface for generating text, completing prompts, answering questions, and carrying out other NLP tasks using state-of-the-art machine learning models.

The ChatGPT API is used for chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content generation. It can also be used for language translation, sentiment analysis, and content classification. The API is flexible and customizable, allowing developers to fine-tune the model’s performance for their specific use case. Let’s now discover the process of obtaining an API key. This is the first step to accessing the ChatGPT API from your own applications.

### Obtaining an API Key <a href="#_idtextanchor024" id="_idtextanchor024"></a>

To use the ChatGPT API, you will need to obtain an API key. This can be obtained from OpenAI. This key will allow you to authenticate your requests to the API and ensure that only authorized users can access your account.

To obtain an API key, you must access the OpenAI Platform at [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) using your ChatGPT credentials. The OpenAI Platform page provides a central hub for managing your OpenAI resources. Once you have signed up, you can navigate to the API access page: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). On the API access page, you can manage your API keys for the ChatGPT API and other OpenAI services. You can generate new API keys, view and edit the permissions associated with each key, and monitor your usage of the APIs. The page provides a clear overview of your API keys, including their names, types, and creation dates, and allows you to easily revoke or regenerate keys as needed.

Click on the **+Create new secret key** button and your API key will be created:

![Figure 1.4: Creating an API Key](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.04\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.4: Creating an API Key

After creating your API key, you will only have one chance to copy it (see _Figure 1.5_). It’s important to keep your API key secure and confidential, as anyone who has access to your key could potentially access your account and use your resources. You should also be careful not to share your key with unauthorized users and avoid committing your key to public repositories or sharing it in plain text over insecure channels.

![Figure 1.5: Saving an API Key](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.05\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.5: Saving an API Key

Copying and pasting the API key in our applications and scripts allows us to use the ChatGPT API. Now, let’s examine the ChatGPT tokens and their involvement in the OpenAI pricing model.

### API Tokens and Pricing <a href="#_idtextanchor026" id="_idtextanchor026"></a>

When working with ChatGPT APIs, it’s important to understand the concept of tokens. Tokens are the basic units of text used by models to process and understand the input and output text.

Tokens can be words or chunks of characters and are created by breaking down the text into smaller pieces. For instance, the word _“hamburger”_ can be broken down into _“ham_,_”_ _“bur_,_”_ and _“ger_,_”_ while a shorter word such as _“pear”_ is a single token. Tokens can also start with whitespace, such as _“ hello”_ or _“ bye”._

The number of tokens used in an API request depends on the length of both the input and output text. As a rule of thumb, one token corresponds to approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words in English text. It’s important to note that the combined length of the text prompt and generated response must not exceed the maximum context length of the model. _Table 1.1_ shows the token limits of some of the popular ChatGPT models.

| **MODEL**        | **MAX TOKENS** |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| gpt-4            | 8,192 tokens   |
| gpt-4-32k        | 32,768 tokens  |
| gpt-3.5-turbo    | 4,096 tokens   |
| text-davinci-003 | 4,096 tokens   |

Table 1.1: API model token limits

To learn more about how text is translated into tokens, you can check out OpenAI’s **Tokenizer** tool. The tokenizer tool is a helpful resource provided by OpenAI for understanding how text is translated into tokens. This tool breaks down text into individual tokens and displays their corresponding byte offsets, which can be useful for analyzing and understanding the structure of your text.

You can find the tokenizer tool at [https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer). To use the tokenizer tool, simply enter the text you want to analyze and select the appropriate model and settings. The tool will then generate a list of tokens, along with their corresponding byte offsets (_see Figure 1.6_).

![Figure 1.6: The Tokenizer Tool](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.06\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.6: The Tokenizer Tool

The ChatGPT API pricing is structured such that you are charged per 1,000 tokens processed, with a minimum charge per API request. This means that the longer your input and output texts are, the more tokens will be processed and the higher the cost will be. _Table 1.2_ displays the cost of processing 1,000 tokens for several commonly used ChatGPT models.

| **MODEL**        | **PROMPT**          | **COMPLETION**      |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| gpt-4            | $0.03 / 1K tokens   | $0.06 / 1K tokens   |
| gpt-4-32k        | $0.06 / 1K tokens   | $0.12 / 1K tokens   |
| gpt-3.5-turbo    | $0.002 / 1K tokens  | $0.002 / 1K tokens  |
| text-davinci-003 | $0.0200 / 1K tokens | $0.0200 / 1K tokens |

Table 1.2: ChatGPT API Model Pricing

Important note

It is important to keep an eye on your token usage to avoid unexpected charges. You can track your usage and monitor your billing information through the **Usage** dashboard at [https://platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).

As you can see, ChatGPT is has easy-to-use interface that allows developers to interact with GPT models for natural language processing tasks. Tokens are the basic units of text used by the models to process and understand the input and output text. The pricing structure for the ChatGPT API is based on the number of tokens processed, with a minimum charge per API request.

In the next section, we will cover how to set up the Python development environment for working with the ChatGPT API. This involves installing Python and the PyCharm IDE, setting up a virtual environment, and installing the necessary Python packages. Additionally, we will give you instructions on how to create a Python virtual environment using the built-in **venv** module and how to access the **Terminal** tab within PyCharm.

## Setting Up Your Python Development Environment <a href="#_idtextanchor028" id="_idtextanchor028"></a>

Before we start writing our first code, it’s important to create an environment to work in and install any necessary dependencies. Fortunately, Python has an excellent tooling system for managing virtual environments. Virtual environments in Python are a complex topic, but for the purposes of this book, it’s enough to know that they are isolated Python environments that are separate from your global Python installation. This isolation allows developers to work with different Python versions, install packages within the environment, and manage project dependencies without interfering with Python’s global installation.

In order to utilize the ChatGPT API in your NLP projects, you will need to set up your Python development environment. This section will guide you through the necessary steps to get started, including the following:

* Installing Python
* Installing the PyCharm IDE
* Installing pip
* Setting up a virtual environment
* Installing the required Python packages

A properly configured development environment will allow you to make API requests to ChatGPT and process the resulting responses in your Python code.

### Installing Python and the PyCharm IDE <a href="#_idtextanchor029" id="_idtextanchor029"></a>

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for various purposes, including machine learning and data analysis. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website, [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have downloaded the Python installer, simply follow the instructions to install Python on your computer. The next step is to choose an **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**) to work with (see _Figure 1.7_).

![Figure 1.7: Python Installation](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.07\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.7: Python Installation

One popular choice among Python developers is PyCharm, a powerful and user-friendly IDE developed by JetBrains. PyCharm provides a wide range of features that make it easy to develop Python applications, including code completion, debugging tools, and project management capabilities.

To install PyCharm, you can download the Community Edition for free from the JetBrains website, [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). Once you have downloaded the installer, simply follow the instructions to install PyCharm on your computer.

### Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment <a href="#_idtextanchor030" id="_idtextanchor030"></a>

Setting up a Python virtual environment is a crucial step in creating an isolated development environment for your project. By creating a virtual environment, you can install specific versions of Python packages and dependencies without interfering with other projects on your system.

Creating a Python virtual environment specific to your ChatGPT application project is a recommended best practice. By doing so, you can ensure that all the packages and dependencies are saved inside your project folder rather than cluttering up your computer’s global Python installation. This approach provides a more organized and isolated environment for your project’s development and execution.

PyCharm allows you to set up the Python virtual environment directly during the project creation process. Once installed, you can launch PyCharm and start working with Python. Upon launching PyCharm, you will see the **Welcome Window**, and from there, you can create a new project. By doing so, you will be directed to the **New Project** window, where you can specify your desired project name and, more importantly, set up your Python virtual environment. To do this, you need to ensure that **New environment using** is selected. This option will create a copy of the Python version installed on your device and save it to your local project.

As you can see from _Figure 1.8_, the **Location** field displays the directory path of your local Python virtual environment situated within your project directory. Beneath it, **Base interpreter** displays the installed Python version on your system. Clicking the **Create** button will initiate the creation of your new project.

![Figure 1.8: PyCharm Project Setup](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.08\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.8: PyCharm Project Setup

_Figure 1.9_ displays the two main indicators showing that the Python virtual environment is correctly installed and activated. One of these indications is the presence of a **venv** folder within your PyCharm project, which proves that the environment is installed. Additionally, you should observe **Python 3.11 (ChatGPTResponse)** in the lower-right corner, confirming that your virtual environment has been activated successfully.

![Figure 1.9: Python Virtual Environment Indications](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.09\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.9: Python Virtual Environment Indications

A key component needed to install any package in Python is **pip**. Lets’s see how to check whether pip is already installed on your system, and how to install it if necessary.

### The pip Package Installer <a href="#_idtextanchor032" id="_idtextanchor032"></a>

pip is a package installer for Python. It allows you to easily install and manage third-party Python libraries and packages such as **openai**. If you are using a recent version of Python, **pip** should already be installed. You can check whether pip is installed on your system by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing **pip** followed by the _Enter_ key. If **pip** is installed, you should see some output describing its usage and commands.

If **pip** is not installed on your system, you can install it by following these steps:

1. First, download the **get-pip.py** script from the official Python website: [https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
2. Save the file to a location on your computer that you can easily access, such as your desktop or downloads folder.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the **get-pip.py** file.
4. Run the following command to install pip: **python get-pip.py**
5. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that pip is installed by typing **pip** into the command prompt or terminal and pressing _Enter_.

You should now have pip installed on your system and be able to use it to install packages and libraries for Python.

### Building a Python Virtual Environment from the Terminal <a href="#_idtextanchor033" id="_idtextanchor033"></a>

Alternatively, to create a Python virtual environment, you can use the built-in **venv** module that comes with Python. Once you create your project in PyCharm, click on the **Terminal** tab located at the bottom of the screen. If you don’t see the **Terminal** tab, you can open it by going to **View** | **Tool Windows** | **Terminal** in the menu bar. Then, run this command:

```
$ python3 -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new directory named **myenv** that contains the virtual environment. You can replace **myenv** with any name you want.

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

*   On Windows:

    <pre><code><strong>$ myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
    </strong></code></pre>
*   On macOS or Linux:

    <pre><code><strong>$ source myenv/bin/activate
    </strong></code></pre>

Once activated, you should see the name of the virtual environment in the command prompt or terminal. From here, you can install any packages or dependencies you need for your project without interfering with other Python installations on your system.

This was a complete guide on how to set up a Python development environment for using the ChatGPT API in NLP projects. The steps included installing Python, the PyCharm IDE, and **pip**, and setting up a virtual environment. Setting up a virtual environment was a crucial step in creating an isolated development environment for your project. You are now ready to complete your first practice exercise on using the ChatGPT API with Python to interact with the OpenAI library.

## A Simple ChatGPT API Response <a href="#_idtextanchor035" id="_idtextanchor035"></a>

Using the ChatGPT API with Python is a relatively simple process. You’ll first need to make sure you create a new PyCharm project called **ChatGPTResponse** (see _Figure 1.8_). Once you have that set up, you can use the OpenAI Python library to interact with the ChatGPT API. Open a new Terminal in PyCharm, make sure that you are in your project folder, and install the **openai** package:

```
$ pip install openai
```

Next, you need to create a new Python file in your PyCharm project. In the top-left corner, right-click on **ChatGPTResponse** | **New** | **Python File**. Name the file **app.py** and hit _Enter_. You should now have a new Python file in your project directory.

![Figure 1.10: Create a Python File](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.10\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.10: Create a Python File

To get started, you’ll need to import the **openai** library into your Python file. Also, you’ll need to provide your OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key from the OpenAI website by following the steps outlined in the previous sections of this book. Then you’ll need to set it as a parameter in your Python code. Once your API key is set up, you can start interacting with the ChatGPT API:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace **YOUR\_API\_KEY** with the API key you obtained from the OpenAI platform page. Now, you can ask the user for a question using the **input()** function:

```
question = input("What would you like to ask ChatGPT? ")
```

The **input()** function is used to prompt the user to input a question they would like to ask the ChatGPT API. The function takes a string as an argument, which is displayed to the user when the program is run. In this case, the question string is **"What would you like to ask ChatGPT?"**. When the user types their question and presses _Enter_, the **input()** function will return the string that the user typed. This string is then assigned to the **question** variable.

To pass the user question from your Python script to ChatGPT, you will need to use the ChatGPT API **Completion** function:

```
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-003",
    prompt=question,
    max_tokens=1024,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.8,
)
```

The **openai.Completion.create()** function in the code is used to send a request to the ChatGPT API to generate the completion of the user’s input prompt. The **engine** parameter allows us to specify the specific variant or version of the GPT model we want to utilize for the request, and in this case, it is set to **"text-davinci-003"**. The **prompt** parameter specifies the text prompt for the API to complete, which is the user’s input question in this case.

The **max\_tokens** parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens the request and the response should contain together. The **n** parameter specifies the number of completions to generate for the prompt. The **stop** parameter specifies the sequence where the API should stop generating the response.

The **temperature** parameter controls the creativity of the generated response. It ranges from **0** to **1**. Higher values will result in more creative but potentially less coherent responses, while lower values will result in more predictable but potentially less interesting responses. Later in the book, we will delve into how these parameters impact the responses received from ChatGPT.

The function returns a **JSON object** containing the generated response from the ChatGPT API, which then can be accessed and printed to the console in the next line of code:

```
print(response)
```

In the project pane on the left-hand side of the screen, locate the Python file you want to run. Right-click on the **app.py** file and select **Run app.py** from the context menu. You should receive a message in the **Run** window that asks you to write a question to ChatGPT (see _Figure 1.11_).

![Figure 1.11: Asking ChatGPT a Question](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/Figure\_1.11\_B21110.jpg)

Figure 1.11: Asking ChatGPT a Question

Once you have entered your question, press the _Enter_ key to submit your request to the ChatGPT API. The response generated by the ChatGPT API model will be displayed in the **Run** window as a complete JSON object:

```
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "text": "\n\n1. Start by getting in the water. If you're swimming in a pool, you can enter the water from the side, ………….
    }
  ],
  "created": 1681010983,
  "id": "cmpl-73G2JJCyBTfwCdIyZ7v5CTjxMiS6W",
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 415,
    "prompt_tokens": 4,
    "total_tokens": 419
  }
}
```

This JSON response produced by the OpenAI API contains information about the response generated by the GPT-3 model. This response consists of the following fields:

* The **choices** field contains an array of objects with the generated responses, which in this case only contains one response object as the parameter **n=1**.
* The **text** field within the response object contains the actual response generated by the GPT-3 model.
* The **finish\_reason** field indicates the reason why the response was generated; in this case, it was because the model reached the **stop** condition provided in the request. Since in our case **stop=None**, the full response from the ChatGPT API was returned.
* The **created** field specifies the Unix timestamp of when the response was created.
* The **id** field is a unique identifier for the API request that generated this response.
* The **model** field specifies the GPT-3 model that was used to generate the response.
* The **object** field specifies the type of object that was returned, which in this case is **text\_completion**.
* The **usage** field provides information about the resource usage of the API request. It contains information about the number of tokens used for the completion, the number of tokens in the prompt, and the total number of tokens used.

The most important parameter from the response is the **text** field, which contains the answer to the question asked to the ChatGPT API. This is why most API users would like to access only that parameter from the JSON object. You can easily separate the text from the main body as follows:

```
answer = response["choices"][0]["text"]
print(answer)
```

By following this approach, you can guarantee that the **answer** variable will hold the complete ChatGPT API text response, which you can then print to verify. Keep in mind that ChatGPT responses can significantly differ depending on the input, making each response unique.

1. Start by getting in the water. If you're swimming in a pool, you can enter the water from the side, ladder, or diving board. If you are swimming in the ocean or lake, you can enter the water from the shore or a dock.
2. Take a deep breath in and then exhale slowly. This will help you relax and prepare for swimming.

ChatGPT can be employed for a multitude of NLP tasks across a wide array of topics accessible in the vast expanse of available data. We can utilize our script to inquire about diverse areas of expertise and receive advanced responses from the ChatGPT API, as demonstrated here:

1. Mathematics:
   * User: What is the square root of 256?
   * ChatGPT: The square root of 256 is 16.
2. Sentiment analysis:
   * User: Analyze the sentiment of the sentence “I had a great day today!”
   * ChatGPT: The sentiment of the sentence “I had a great day today!” is positive.
3. Programming:
   * User: How do you declare a variable in Python?
   * ChatGPT: To declare a variable in Python, you can use the following syntax: **variable\_name = value**.
4. Science:
   * User: What is the process of photosynthesis in plants?
   * ChatGPT: The process of photosynthesis in plants is the fundamental mechanism by which they convert light energy into chemical energy.
5. Literature:
   * User: What are the major themes in Shakespeare’s play “Hamlet”?
   * ChatGPT: “Hamlet,” one of Shakespeare’s most renowned tragedies, explores several major themes that continue to captivate audiences and provoke thought.

In this section, you learned how to use the OpenAI Python library to interact with the ChatGPT API by sending a request to generate the completion of a user’s input prompt/question. You also learned how to set up your API key and how to prompt the user to input a question, and finally, how to access the generated response from ChatGPT in the form of a JSON object containing information about the response. You are now ready to build more complex projects and integrate the ChatGPT API with other frameworks.
