By the end of the chapter, you will have acquired the essential knowledge to develop a simple yet functional Desktop application by seamlessly integrating the ChatGPT API with Tkinter and Microsoft Word. With these skills, you will be able to utilize AI-powered language translation and seamlessly incorporate this feature into any application of your choice, providing you with a valuable tool to effectively communicate with individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

## Technical Requirements <a href="#_idtextanchor089" id="_idtextanchor089"></a>

To complete this language translation desktop app project, you will need the following technical requirements:

* Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine
* A code editor, such as PyCharm (recommended)
* A Python virtual environment
* An OpenAI API key
* Microsoft Word available on your device

In the upcoming section, you will discover how to effectively employ the **docx** Python library to access and extract information from Word documents. This will enable you to seamlessly pass the data to the ChatGPT API and leverage its power to perform translations.

You can locate the code snippets demonstrated in this chapter on the GitHub platform through this link: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter06%20WordTranslator](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-AI-Applications-with-ChatGPT-APIs/tree/main/Chapter06%20WordTranslator)

## Integrating ChatGPT API with Microsoft Office <a href="#_idtextanchor090" id="_idtextanchor090"></a>

In this section, we will explore how to set up a PyCharm project and install the **docx** Python library to extract text from **Word** documents. The **docx** library is a Python package that allows us to read and write Microsoft Word (**.docx**) files and provides a convenient interface to access information stored in these files.

The first step is to initiate your work by creating a new PyCharm project. This will enable you to have a dedicated area to craft and systematize your translation app code. Although we have previously discussed how to develop a PyCharm project, I will still outline the steps for you here.

1. Open **PyCharm IDE** on your system.
2. Click on **Create New Project** from the welcome screen or go to **File** | **New Project** if you’re already in the IDE.
3. Keep the default settings.
4. Give your project the name **Translation App**.
5. Click on **Create** to create the project.

To run the language translation desktop app, you will need to install the following libraries:

* **openai**: The **openai** library allows you to interact with the OpenAI API and perform various natural language processing tasks
* **docx**: The **docx** library allows you to read and write Microsoft Word **.docx** files using Python
* **tkinter**: The **tkinter** library is a built-in Python library that allows you to create **graphical user interfaces** (**GUIs**) for your desktop app

As **tkinter** is a built-in library, there is no need for installation, since it already exists within your Python environment. To install the **openai** and **docx** libraries, access the PyCharm terminal by clicking on **View** | **Tool Windows** | **Terminal**, and then execute the following commands:

```
pip install openai
pip install python-docx
```

To access and read the contents of a Word document, you will need to create a sample Word file inside your PyCharm project. Here are the steps to create a new Word file in PyCharm:

1. In the PyCharm project, right-click on the project directory, select **New**, and create a directory called **files**.
2. Right-click on the **files** folder and select **New** | **File**.
3. In the dialog box that appears, enter a filename with the **.docx** extension – for example, **info.docx**.
4. Press the _Enter_ key to create the file.
5. Once the file is created, double-click on it to open it.

You can now add some text or content to this file, which we will later access and read using the **docx** library in Python. For this example, we have created an article about New York City. However, you can choose any Word document containing text that you want to analyze:

_The United States’ most populous city, often referred to as New York City or NYC, is New York. In 2020, its population reached 8,804,190 people across 300.46 square miles, making it the most densely populated major city in the country and over two times more populous than the nation’s second-largest city, Los Angeles. The city’s population also exceeds that of 38 individual U.S. states. Situated at the southern end of New York State, New York City serves as the Northeast megalopolis and New York metropolitan area’s geographic and demographic center - the largest metropolitan area in the country by both urban area and population. Over 58 million people also live within 250 miles of the city. A significant influencer on commerce, health care and life sciences, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports, New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media hub. It houses the headquarters of the United Nations, making it a significant center for international diplomacy, and is often referred to as the world’s capital._

Now that you have created the Word file inside your PyCharm project, you can move on to the next step, which is to create a new Python file called **app.py** inside the **Translation App** root directory. This file will contain the code to read and manipulate the contents of the Word file using the **docx** library. With the Word file and the Python file in place, you are ready to start writing the code to extract data from the document and use it in your application.

To test whether we can read Word files with the **docx-python** library, we can implement the following code in our **app.py** file:

```
import docx
doc = docx.Document("<full_path_to_docx_file>")
text = ""
for para in doc.paragraphs:
    text += para.text
print(text)
```

Make sure to replace **\<full\_path\_to\_docx\_file>** with the actual path to your **Word** document file. Obtaining the file path is a simple task, achieved by right-clicking on your **.docx** file in PyCharm and selecting the **Copy Path/Reference…** option from the drop-down menu.

Once you have done that, run the **app.py** file by single-clicking on the **Run** button and verify the output. This code will read the contents of your Word document and print them to the **Run Window** console. If the text extraction works correctly, you should see the text of your document printed in the console (see _Figure 6.1_). The **text** variable now holds the data from **info.docx** as a Python string.

![Figure 6.1: Word Text Extraction Console Output](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_06\_1.jpg)

Figure 6.1: Word Text Extraction Console Output

This section provided a step-by-step guide on how to set up a PyCharm project and install the **docx** Python library to extract text from Word documents. The section also included instructions on how to create a new Word file in PyCharm and use the **docx** library to read and manipulate its contents, using Python.

In the upcoming section, we will dive into building the frame of our Tkinter application. You will learn how to create a basic window with widgets and how to use geometry managers to position them on the screen.

## Building a User Interface with Tkinter <a href="#_idtextanchor091" id="_idtextanchor091"></a>

In this section, we will learn how to use the **Tkinter** library to create a GUI for our text translation application. Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating GUIs, and it provides a simple and efficient way to create windows, buttons, text fields, and other graphical elements.

The **Text Translator** application shown in _Figure 6.2_ will be designed to have a simple and user-friendly interface. When you run the application, there will be a button labeled **Browse** and a drop-down menu with a list of languages to translate to.

To translate the text, the user can select the language they want to translate to from the drop-down menu. Once the language is selected, the user can click on the **Browse** button and select the Word file they want to translate. Upon selection, the contents of the file will be translated using the ChatGPT API, and the translated text will be displayed in the large text field in the center of the window. The user can then copy and paste the translated text to use it as needed.

The Text Translator application is designed to be a simple and efficient tool to translate text from one language to another.

Important Note

We do not need to specify the text from which we want to translate, as the ChatGPT language model is designed to automatically recognize the prompt language.

![Figure 6.2: The Text Translator Application UI](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781805127567/files/image/B21110\_06\_2.jpg)

Figure 6.2: The Text Translator Application UI

Now that we are clear about the base design, we can bring it to life with Tkinter. To get started, we’ll need to remove the example code that we previously added to our **app.py** file. Simply delete all the lines of code containing the example code so that we can start with a clean slate.

Creating a Tkinter window is the next step in building our text translator application. You can achieve this by writing the following code in **app.py**, which initializes a new instance of the **Tk** class and sets the application window:

```
import openai
import docx
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Text Translator")
root.configure(bg="white")
header_font = ("Open Sans", 16, "bold")
header = tk.Label(root,
                  text="Text Translator",
                  bg="white",
                  font=header_font,
                  )
header.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=2, pady=20)
root.mainloop()
```

To start building the Tkinter app, we first need to import the necessary libraries. We will use the **openai**, **docx**, and **tkinter** libraries for this project. Next, we need to create the main window of our application. We will do this using the **Tk()** method of the **tkinter** library. We will also give our application a title and set its background color to white.

We can also set a header for our application using the **Label()** method of **tkinter**. We can set its text to **Text Translator**, its background color to **white**, and its font to **Open Sans**, with a size of **16** and a **bold** weight. We will then use the **grid()** method to place the header in our application window at a specific position by specifying the **row** and **column** values, spanning two columns and with a small padding.

We will run our application using the **mainloop()** method of **tkinter**. The **mainloop()** method is an infinite loop used to run the application, listen for events such as button clicks or window resizing, and update the display as needed. It continuously listens for events until the user closes the window or exits the application.

After creating the app window, the next step is to add elements to it. One of those elements will be the **Browse** button:

```
browse_button = tk.Button(root, text="Browse",
                          bg="#4267B2", fg="black", relief="flat",
                          borderwidth=0, activebackground="#4267B2",
                          activeforeground="white")
browse_button.config(font=("Arial", 12, "bold"), width=10, height=2)
browse_button.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=20, pady=20)
```

Important Note

It’s important to add all elements before calling the **mainloop()** method, so they are properly included in the application window. **mainloop()** should always be the last line in your **app.py** file.

To create a button widget, you can use the **tk.Button()** method in the **tkinter** library. The button is placed in the root window and has the **Browse** text displayed on it. The **bg** parameter sets the background color of the button to a dark blue, while **fg** sets the foreground color to **black**. Meanwhile, **relief** is set to **flat** to create a flat appearance, and **borderwidth** is set to **0** to remove the border of the button. We then use the **activebackground** and **activeforeground** parameters to set the colors of the button when it is clicked or hovered over.

Under the **Browse** button, we can create a drop-down menu with a list of languages:

```
languages = ["Bulgarian", "Hindi", "Spanish", "French"]
language_var = tk.StringVar(root)
language_var.set(languages[0])
language_menu = tk.OptionMenu(root, language_var, *languages)
language_menu.config(font=("Arial", 12), width=10)
language_menu.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=20, pady=20)
```

The **languages** list contains a list of languages that the user can select from. You can add any language to that list, and it will be displayed to the users in the drop-down menu.

The **language\_var** variable is created as a **StringVar** object and set to the first language in the list. The **set()** method of the **language\_var** object is then used to set its initial value to the first element of the **languages** list. This is done so that the default value of the language drop-down menu is the first language in the list, which is **Bulgarian** in this case.

The **OptionMenu** widget is then created with the **language\_var** variable and the **\*languages** syntax, which unpacks the **languages** list as individual arguments. This sets the available options for the drop-down menu to the languages in the languages list. Then, we configure and position an options menu widget in the second column of the first row of the application window.

The next step is to add the text field to our GUI. To do this, you can add the following code below the **Language** menu in your **app.py** file. This code creates a text field with specific dimensions, colors, and properties, and then places it within the window using grid positioning:

```
text_field = tk.Text(root, height=20, width=50, bg="white", fg="black", 
                     relief="flat", borderwidth=0, wrap="word")
text_field.grid(row=2, column=0, columnspan=2, padx=20, pady=20)
text_field.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
text_field.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
root.grid_rowconfigure(2, weight=1)
root.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
root.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1)
```

This code will add a text field to the GUI window, which will be used to display the ChatGPT translation of the Word document. Firstly, the **Text** widget object named **text\_field** is placed inside the root window. The **Text** widget is used to display and edit text in multiple lines. Then, we use the **grid()** method to position the **Text** widget on the GUI. The **padx** and **pady** parameters add padding around the widget to create some space between it and other widgets in the window.

You can configure **text\_field** to to expand the main window horizontally and vertically, using the **grid\_rowconfigure()** and **grid\_columnconfigure()** methods. This allows the text field to fill up the available space in the window. Then, you can also configure the main window, **root**, to expand it. These settings ensure that the text field remains centered in the window and fills up the available space.

Once your GUI is finalized, you can launch the application, and confirm that your GUI adheres precisely to the style and attributes shown in _Figure 6.2_. By selecting the **Languages** menu with a single click, you can access and choose any language from it.

This is how you can use the Tkinter library to create a GUI for a text translation application. We have created the main window, header, **Browse** button, and drop-down menu with a list of languages.

Despite having completed your GUI, clicking on the **Browse** button with a single click will not trigger any action, as it is not yet connected to any active Python function. We will fix that in the next section, where we will create two core functions that are responsible for opening the Microsoft Word file and performing the translation.

## Integrating Microsoft Word Text with the ChatGPT API <a href="#_idtextanchor092" id="_idtextanchor092"></a>

In this section, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to create two core functions using Python, which are crucial to building a text translation application. The first function, **translate\_text()**, uses **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5** language model to translate text from a Microsoft Word file into a target language selected by the user. The second function, **browse\_file()**, allows users to browse and select a Word file from their local system and trigger the text translation process. Both functions will be explained in detail with code examples to help you understand and implement them in your own projects.

### Translating a Word Text with ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo <a href="#_idtextanchor093" id="_idtextanchor093"></a>

In this section, you will learn how to build the **translate\_text()** function. This function is responsible for translating the text of a Microsoft Word file into the language chosen by the user through the GUI. We will use the OpenAI API, specifically the GPT 3.5 Turbo model, to translate the text.

Before building the **translate\_text()** function, you will need to create a file called **config.py** in your project root directory. This file will contain your OpenAI API token, which is required to use the OpenAI API. The API token should be assigned to a variable called **API\_KEY** in the **config.py** file:

config.py

```
API_KEY = "<YOUR_CHATGPT_API_KEY>"
```

app.py

<pre><code>import openai
import docx
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
<strong>import config
</strong><strong>openai.api_key = config.API_KEY
</strong></code></pre>

This step is necessary to keep the API token secure and prevent it from being accidentally uploaded to a public repository.

With the API key in place, you can now proceed to implement the **translate\_text()** function in our **app.py**, as demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```
def translate_text(file_location, target_language):
    doc = docx.Document(file_location)
    text = ""
    for para in doc.paragraphs:
        text += para.text
    model_engine = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model_engine,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "You are a professional                                          language translator. "
                                        "Below I will ask you to                                          translate text. "
                                        "I expect from you to give me                                          the correct translation"
                                        "Can you help me with that?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes I can help you with                 that."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Translate the following text                 in {target_language} : {text}"}
        ]
    )
    translated_text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    return translated_text
```

The **translate\_text()** function takes two parameters – **file\_location**, which is the location of the Microsoft Word file to be translated, and **target\_language**, which is the language to translate the text into. The first line of the function uses the **docx** module to open the Word document located at **file\_location**. The next few lines of code create an empty string text and then loop through each paragraph in the document, concatenating the text from each paragraph to the text string. In other words, we can extract all the text from the Word document and store it in a single string.

Then, the GPT-3.5 API model is used to translate the text. The **model\_engine** variable is set to the GPT-3.5 model. A **response** variable is created by calling the **openai.ChatCompletion.create()** method, which sends a prompt message to the API, requesting a response to translate the given text into the specified **target\_language**.

The **messages** argument is a list of dictionaries that represent the conversation between the user and the language translator.

The **messages** variable is used to pass a conversation history to the language model for translation. The conversation consists of messages exchanged between a user and an assistant, using the ChatGPT API.

Let’s break down the design of the **messages** variable:

* The variable is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a message with two key-value pairs:
  * **role**: This represents the role of the participant in the conversation. It can be either **user** or **assistant**.
  * **content**: This represents the actual content of the message.
* The conversation follows a pattern, with the first two messages establishing the context and the last message providing the text to be translated:
  * The first message is from the user’s role and explains the context of the interaction
  * The second message is from the assistant’s role and confirms its ability to help
  * The third message is from the user’s role and contains the text to be translated, including the target language

The conversation format is designed to give context to the language model about the task it needs to perform, making it clear that the user wants the assistant to translate the given text into the specified target language.

The **role** key specifies whether the message is from the user or the assistant, and the **content** key contains the actual message text. The final translated text is obtained from the **response** object and returned by the function.

After sending the message with the text to be translated and the target language to the GPT-3.5 API model, the response will be a JSON object containing various information about the response generated by the model. For this model, the actual translation is stored in the **content** field of the first choice in the **choices** list of the response. Therefore, the code extracts the translated text by accessing the **content** field of the first choice and assigns it to the **translated\_text** variable, which is then returned by the function.

Once we have processed the translated text into a Python string, we can display it to the user. In addition to that, we need to implement a function to establish the path to our Word file using the **Browse** button. This can be done by building the **browse\_file()** function:

```
def browse_file():
    file_location = filedialog.askopenfilename(initialdir="/",
                                               title="Select file",
                                               filetypes=(("Word files", "*.docx"), ("all files", "*.*")))
    if file_location:
        # Get the selected language from the dropdown menu
        target_language = language_var.get()
        translated_text = translate_text(file_location,             target_language)
        text_field.delete("1.0", tk.END)
        text_field.insert(tk.END, translated_text)
```

The **browse\_file()** function creates a file dialog window that allows the user to select a Word file to be translated. If the user selects a file, the function retrieves the selected language from a drop-down menu, and then it calls the **translate\_text()** function with the file location and target language as parameters. Once the text has been translated, the function clears the text field and inserts the translated text into it.

The function opens a file dialog window for the user to select a Word file to translate. The **initialdir** parameter sets the initial directory to be displayed when the file dialog opens, and the **title** parameter sets the title of the file dialog window. The **filetypes** parameter specifies the file types that the user can select in the file dialog. In this case, the user can select files with a **.docx** extension. The path of the selected file is stored in the **file\_location** variable.

Then, we check whether a file has been selected; if so, then we can retrieve the selected language from a drop-down menu using the **language\_var.get()** function. The **translate\_text()** function is called, with the selected file location and target language as arguments to translate the text in the file to the target language.

After the text is translated, we can delete any text that may be in the text field and insert the translated text into the text field. The text field is the GUI widget that displays the translated text in our app.

Finally, you can add another parameter to **browse\_button**, ensuring that the **browse\_file()** function is activated upon a single click of the button:

<pre><code>browse_button = tk.Button(root, text="Browse",
                          bg="#4267B2", fg="black", relief="flat",
                          borderwidth=0, activebackground="#4267B2",
<strong>                          activeforeground="white",                           command=browse_file)
</strong></code></pre>

The **command=browse\_file** parameter associates the **browse\_file()** function with the **tk.Button** widget. When the button is clicked, the **browse\_file()** function will be executed.

To run and test the application in PyCharm, you can simply click on the **Run** button located in the top-right corner of the PyCharm window, or you can use the _Shift_ + _F10_ keyboard shortcut. This will start the application and open the GUI window. From there, you can select the target language from the drop-down menu and click on the **Browse** button to select a Word file (see _Figure 6.3_).

In this section, you learned how to build the **translate\_text()** function in Python using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model, translating text in a Microsoft Word file into a language selected by the user through a GUI. We also discussed how to build the **browse\_file()** function to get the path to the Word file using the **Browse** button, displaying the translated text to the user.

## Summary <a href="#_idtextanchor094" id="_idtextanchor094"></a>

In this chapter, you learned how to develop a text translation application that can translate text from a Microsoft Word file into a target language selected by the user. The chapter covered the integration of Microsoft Word with the ChatGPT API using Python.

We learned how to use Tkinter to create a user interface for the text translation application. The user interface comprised a simple and user-friendly design that included a drop-down menu, with a list of languages to translate to, and a **Browse** button that allowed users to select a Word file. Once the user selected a file, the contents of the file were translated using the ChatGPT API, and the translated text was displayed in the large text field in the center of the window.

We also saw how to set up a **docx** Python library to extract text from Word documents. The **docx** library provided an interface to access information stored in Word files.

In the next chapter, _Building an Outlook Email Reply Generator_, you will learn how to build an **Outlook** Email Reply Generator application using the most advanced ChatGPT model – **GPT-4**. You will learn how to pass email data from Outlook to the ChatGPT API and use it to generate an original reply to a specific email. You will also learn how to automate the ChatGPT API prompt to get relevant email replies.
