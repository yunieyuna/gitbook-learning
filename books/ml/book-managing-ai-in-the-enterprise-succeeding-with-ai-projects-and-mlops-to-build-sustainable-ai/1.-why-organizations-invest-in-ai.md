# 1. Why Organizations Invest in AI

In some companies, managers seem to have a pact with AI service and software providers to treat AI as magic: No one understands what happens, but AI promises to deliver exactly what everyone hopes for, even if nobody knows what the result should be. Data scientists love such projects. They can do whatever excites them most – at least until some higher-level manager pulls the plug and terminates the project.

Such project failures root in mixing two aspects: first, what gets managers interested and, second, which projects deliver value to the company. Getting managers interested is simple because they have no other choice. The _Harvard Business Review_ ran several articles about AI and data-driven organizations, catapulting this topic to the board level. CEOs and COOs want and have to transform their organization. The challenge is the second part: shaping and delivering a successful AI project. Here, the CIO’s role is to build and run the technical foundation, for example, AI and data management capabilities. The excellent news for IT is that funding is guaranteed under such circumstances. Instead, they face a different challenge: identifying the right software products, services, and partners in a fragmented market. It feels like an AI gold rush at this very moment. Corporations invest and set up programs; startups work hard on innovations; consulting companies readjust their business. Vendors rebrand old-fashioned services to sound sexy and appealing in the new world.

A complex market, new requirements, and the pressure to meet the board’s expectations are a daunting combination for senior managers. They face a situation similar to a giant puzzle with hundreds or thousands of pieces. Randomly selecting a puzzle piece and finding matching ones tends to be less successful than investing some time to get an overview first. Consequently, this chapter puts AI into the corporate context of a data-driven organization by answering the following questions:

* What are the specifics of data-driven companies, and how does AI help?
* How can projects and initiatives calculate the business value of AI projects and services? How can project managers craft a business case?
* How do data-driven companies innovate with AI? Typical sales use cases, and innovative ideas from the fashion industry illustrate how the business perceives AI.
* Why might it be a bad idea to broaden the scope of existing data warehousing (DWH) and business intelligence (BI) teams to cover also AI services?

### The Role of AI in Data-Driven Companies

Artificial intelligence and data-driven organizations – these are probably the two hottest topics for most corporations at the moment. What is unique for each of them, what are the commonalities? C-level managers and corporate strategists need answers when shaping innovation and transformation programs.

In short, the term “data-driven organization” covers two aspects – first, the more technical need for collecting data systematically throughout the entire company. Second, the organizational shift in decision-making, focusing (more) on facts and less on seniority. Artificial intelligence helps to make smarter decisions by generating insights and identifying correlations in data humans cannot find in a manual analysis.

In our daily life, we use terms such as data, information, knowledge, or insights interchangeably. Everybody understands, based on the context, what is actually meant. However, precise definitions ease the understanding of data-driven organizations and the role of AI (Figure [1-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).

**Data** is the raw form: 1s and 0s on disk, as part of a stream from an IoT device, or strings and numbers in databases. On this level, we know nothing more about the data. Data itself does not carry any meaning. It might or even might not help to understand the physical or digital world.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484278246/files/images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="../images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png" height="929" width="1717"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-1</p></figcaption></figure>

**Information** is contextualized data. A stream of 1s and 0s becomes a video signal from a camera overseeing an assembly line. In a database, a string now represents a customer name or order ID. A number becomes the profit per year, another the turnover last month. Data becomes information – and has meaning now.

In the foreseeable future, contextualization is and remains a predominantly human task. Automating the identification of employee or customer names or order IDs is straightforward. Understanding whether a table stores order IDs of open orders or of orders where a customer complained is much more difficult to automate. Only humans understand complex data model semantics. They can intellectually penetrate all subtleties of similar-looking, yet different-purposes serving data elements such as open, delivered, and returned orders.

**Actionable insights** – also named “knowledge” – represent collections of information that guide decision-making. Are there irregularities on the assembly line? Which customers return orders most frequently? As the term “actionable insights” suggests, someone has to decide whether and which actions to perform – and AI delivers helpful or necessary input and options.

Historically, generating actionable insights is the domain of white-collar office workers. Managers and analysts transform large Excel tables full of numbers into nice-looking diagrams. This traditional approach has two limitations. First, humans can only comprehend and experiment with a limited number of influencing parameters. Second, while there are examples for statisticians and mathematicians working on core business questions (e.g., actuaries in insurance companies), this is different for most other industry sectors. Most managers and analysts have heard about statistical significance at university decades ago but never applied the concept in practice. Thus, for turning information into actionable insights, artificial intelligence is revolutionary. AI models incorporate highly complex correlations, including non-linearities; plus, AI development methodologies emphasize robust quality control measures.

As a decades-old research, development, and engineering discipline, AI has many facets and three often-mentioned directions or schools of thought:

* **Artificial narrow intelligence** isolates or singles out and solves highly specialized tasks that only humans could previously perform: identifying objects in images or playing chess, for example. Thanks to deep neural networks, narrow AI drives innovations today and transforms society and corporations.
* **Artificial general intelligence** aims to build a human-like intelligent system capable of learning, understanding, and behaving like humans and the human brain.
* **Artificial superintelligence** wants to build even better brains that surpass the human brain and intelligence.

Reminiscences of these concepts are already part of our popular culture. Artificial superintelligence was a topic of the movie HER a few years ago. An innovative new mobile phone generation comes with an AI assistant. These AI assistants are intellectually more advanced than humans – and eventually depart from them and their limited intellect. The Turing test, a 1950s concept from academia, is widely known today. For passing the Turing test, an AI system must be indistinguishable from a real human conversation partner in a chat. Is this already general AI? No. Building an AI system that mimics a human reflects only a very limited aspect of general AI. Also, the Turing test does not require any learning capabilities.

Today’s commercially successful chatbots do not even try to mimic human conversation styles as much as possible. They make it clear that they are just bots. They are not designed to pass a Turing test or achieve the level of general AI. They are perfect examples of narrow AI. They simplify buying or booking processes for online customers or querying support databases by providing a more human-friendly interface than, for example, an SQL command-line interface.

Narrow AI improves the creation of actionable insights. Based on these insides, decisions require some form of judgment. Should a bank clerk call ten potentially interested customers if he can expect that eight might sign a contract? Should he better call 30 instead of ten clients to make 11 instead of eight sales? There is an intruder in the building. Do we call the police, or should the night security guard check the situation?

The rise of narrow AI changes corporate decision-making. An AI model beats specialists with 20 years of experience and a senior title. In the past, there was often no other option than seniority-based decision-making, and most experts have years of experience in their field. They do not just command in dictator-style to prove their power. However, they have no chance against a well-designed AI model, though AI is not the end of senior experts. They remain essential for companies, just with a new focus: for deciding in areas without a dedicated AI model, for challenging whether specific AI models benefit the organization, and for final decisions based on proposals from the AI.

In general, three decision-making patterns are worth mentioning:

* **Decisions based on summarized information**: A domain specialist gathers all relevant data, looks at correlations and dependencies. He decides himself or prepares a proposal for a management decision.
* **Combining the power of AI with human judgment**: AI generates the insights, the final decision stays with humans. This pattern brings benefits for one-time strategic decisions, such as whether to enter the Russian or better the Australian market next year.
* **Autonomous algorithms** : The AI model generates proposals and directly triggers their execution – without any human intervention. This pattern fits operational routine decisions, especially when human judgment is too expensive or too slow. Placing online ads is the perfect example. Algorithms must choose a suitable ad within milliseconds. Plus, a single ad generates only low revenues – a few pennies or sometimes Euros. Human intervention is too expensive and too slow for such use cases.

When considering how data becomes information and information actionable insights and how the different decision patterns work, the idea of being data-driven and the role of AI get evident in the big picture (Figure [1-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)). Data-driven organizations require data and, thus, invest in collecting data and its contextualization to derive information. It is the base for deciding on facts. Either humans or algorithms and AI turn the gathered information into actionable insights, AI is beneficial for repetitive decisions and for filtering out relevant parameters from large and complex data sources. Plus, AI models decide in (near) real-time once the model is trained and do not induce high costs for each decision.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484278246/files/images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="../images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png" height="379" width="1717"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-2</p></figcaption></figure>

When companies become data-driven and introduce AI, their business cases must not cover only the AI capabilities. They must incorporate the expenses for becoming data-driven: establishing capabilities for collecting data from data warehouses or business applications, from IoT devices, and from systems in engineering or service departments – plus expenses (and time and resources) for reengineering the decision-making processes (Figure [1-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)). Looking at these three challenges holistically together – data collection, building AI models, transforming corporate decision-making – is the key to success.

### Calculating the Business Value of AI

A C-level commitment to become a data-driven company and to invest in AI is a nurturing environment for AI projects. Still, building and establishing a concrete AI service needs funding, and funding requires a convincing business case. The business case can be a hurdle for highly innovative projects because quantifying their benefits is a challenge. Luckily, economic research identified four ways IT investments generate value. They help to craft a concrete business case. These four ways or options are:

* **Informational benefits** , for example, delivering information to the decision-makers.
* **Transactional benefits** such as improving daily operation and cutting costs.
* **Strategic benefits** , for example, changing how the company competes in the market or its products’ nature.
* **Transformational benefits** refer to future benefits, for example, due to additional features of a new tool that employees start using once they get acquainted with the tool, and that enable them to optimize their work.

There is a lot of anecdotal evidence for benefits but little systematic empirical work covering many companies. One exception is a study Elisabetta Raguseo performed on French companies of various sizes. In her research, she looked at Big Data technologies. They handle and analyze massive data volumes coming in at high speed and in varying formats. Big data relate closely to data-driven companies or the guiding aim of AI to generate insights from large amounts of data, making her study relevant for this book, too.

Elisabetta found out that enhancing employee productivity is the most relevant transactional benefit in all considered industry sectors. Reducing operating costs was second. The subsequent most relevant strategic benefits are aligning IT with a business strategy and enabling a quicker response to change.

In the area of transformational benefits, expanding capabilities is rated as most important. It can be achieved, for example, by enabling new employees to start quickly working on integrating additional data sources. In the area of informational benefits, they list proving management data, improving data accuracy, providing data in more useable formats, enabling easier access to data, and enabling faster access to data.

There are two key points to consider when applying the insights for your business case for AI projects. First, the area is close, but not the same. Raguseo’s results are good inspirations, not god’s word. Second, company culture and politics impact which of the **benefit types** work best in your organization and your managers:

* Certain benefits are **easy to quantify** – especially (but not only) transactional benefits. The project calculates today’s costs and estimates the potential savings after implementing the project. Such business cases are perfect for companies driven by financial numbers with a strong influence of controllers and like-minded managers.
* There are **vague to quantify** benefits. Will predictive analytics increase sales by 1% or 10%? The calculation in the business case and the actual costs and savings can differ widely. Many strategic and transformational benefits fall into this category. Such arguments convince visionary and innovation-driven decision-makers, not nitpickers.
* The informational benefits are the easiest to fund. When a manager believes to need data, she will fund a project or service if within her budget. There is **no need to quantify** any benefits beforehand.

When the business value is clear, the management decides whether to invest in the transformation to become a data-driven organization and build and extend its AI capabilities. In most cases, AI initiatives start with the low-hanging fruits with easy-to-measure results such as improving and optimizing sales.

### Use Case: Sales Operations Efficiency

Improving sales efficiencies is one example for realizing transactional benefits: more sales, less effort. The use case takes advantage of the power of data (and algorithms) to boost sales and to identify customers potentially terminating their contract. In such use cases, the AI predicts, for example, which customers might buy a product.

Traditionally, sales agents or the sales management would filter customer lists based on their gut feeling to get an idea which customers they could call. It was and is their responsibility to make the right choices when selecting the customers to call. They are responsible for the outcome.

For an AI-generated list, the data scientists are (at least partially) responsible for the sales success. The lists are clear guidelines for sales agents on how to act. If you want to sell office furniture, these are the customers that most likely buy. Call them! These customers might cancel their cable subscriptions. Do something and prevent it! Whoever creates such lists is responsible for their quality.

#### How and Why Up-Selling, Cross-Selling, Churn Use Cases Thrive

There are convincing reasons why cross-selling and churn AI use cases are widespread. First, they are straightforward to implement. AI projects can often rely on the data of a single source system such as an ERP system, a CRM system, or a data warehouse for creating a good model. The advantage: AI projects do not have to bring data from various sources together, which is often a time-consuming task or even a project risk. Second, the transactional benefits are apparent and easy to validate. The AI project goes in the ring against a seasoned marketing and sales professional. Both the marketing professional and the AI choose 50 customers each. These 50 each are the customers, the marketing professional, respectively, the AI thinks they are the customers most likely buying the product. Then, sales reps contact these one hundred customers. They try to close a deal without knowing about the experiment. In the end, you count how many customers bought from the human-generated list, how many from the AI-provided one. The superiority of the AI list should be striking.

This use case, however, needs the active support of the sales organization. What happens if the sales staff opposes the idea? Luckily, data scientists can implement a different use case just with data, without requiring help from other teams: the churn prediction use case. A churn prediction AI model predicts, for example, which customers cancel their mobile phone plan subscription soon. The data scientists generate the list – and wait. Maybe a week, perhaps a month. Then, they check whether their prediction became a reality and present to their management how many customers the company lost because the business ignores AI-generated insights.

Upselling and churn prediction models base on scoring customers, usually assigning values to them between zero and one to customers. The scores indicate how likely a customer buys a product or cancels a contract. Organizations prioritize their call-center resources to contact customers with a high score. They call a customer with a score of 0.57 before reaching out to customers with a score of 0.12 (Figure [1-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). The input variable columns in the table reflect what we know about the customers. Based on these input variables, the scoring function, aka the AI model, calculates the customer affinity for a golden credit card.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484278246/files/images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.png" alt="../images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.png" height="454" width="1717"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-3</p></figcaption></figure>

The effect of using the scores for prioritization is similar to champagne bubbles. “Interesting” customers get to the top of the list as champagne bubbles rise to the top in a champagne flute. Figure [1-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) illustrates this, with the left representing contacting customers randomly and, on the right, choosing them based on a score.

Suppose a call center agent calls a potential customer from this list. If he is interested, he buys because of the call. If we call a customer that is not interested, we “lose” one call.

The table to the right in Figure [1-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) contains the same names; just the order changed, thanks to AI. More customers who want to buy the product are at the top of the list and get called first. In this example, the sales agents close only one deal after four calls for the left table. In contrast, three of the four approached customers sign with the score-based approach reflected in the table to the right. This increase in sales results from the power of AI and analytics – and managers can implement the same and calculate the transactional benefit for their use cases.

#### Hurdles and Prerequisites for Success

Enthusiastic AI evangelists, software vendors, or external consultants sometimes forget to mention two strict **limitations or prerequisites** for the applicability of AI for sales. First, AI requires a sufficiently large training data set. AI algorithms generalize from this training data and learn and create models. No (good) training data means no (good) model.

There is no _historical_ _training data_ when launching a new product the first time, for example, an eco-friendly gold credit card with blinking pink LEDs. Nobody bought this product already. Thus, there is no training data. Creating an AI model is impossible.

The second strict limitation is that these AI use cases help only for **resource shortages** , for example, if the sales organization cannot contact all potential customers. Resource shortages are common in the retail banking mass market, but not in wealth management or when a big European airplane manufacturer sells airplanes to airlines. In the latter cases, each customer generates high revenues. The sales staff’s costs are low compared to the revenues just one deal generates. Airplane manufacturers can afford large sales teams and over-capacity. The implications for AI: no shortage means no need to invest in AI. The sales team is in constant contact with their customers on the C-level and knows who might buy 20 airplanes next year without AI. Potential customers might even approach the airplane manufacturer anyhow. There is no shortage in sales capacity per customer AI could optimize. The bottleneck is how long the sales team can talk with airlines’ top management. CEOs do not have the time to talk hours and hours with one supplier every week. Thus, AI can help identify hidden needs and cross-selling options, enabling the sales staff to present the right ideas and products. In other words: What are the five products and services we should tell a specific customer when we visit him next week? It is an AI functionality everybody knows from online shops: “customers who buy steak and crisps buy German beer as well.”

Besides these two strict limitations – need for adequate training data and AI being helpful (only) in case of resource shortages requiring optimization – there is a third hurdle relating to the business model and company culture. Certain industries and business models rely on a close **personal relationship** between sales staff and customers. Examples are the insurance sector or private banking for super-wealthy customers. Here, the sales staff might see AI as a direct attack on their professional pride, self-conception, and value as an employee. AI (and the IT department) claims to understand customers better than their bank advisors, who know their wealthy clients for decades and met them in-person. Furthermore, the sales staff’s compensation depends on closing deals – and their skill to sell the right product to the right customers. If computers do better, client advisors fear for their long-term relevance for the organization – and their bonuses and commissions.

Fear for their relevance is a work culture aspect that exemplifies that data scientists alone cannot transform the organization into a data-driven company relying on AI for more efficiency. A data scientist can and must create a good model. Dealing with the skepticism, for example, of sales staff, is a change management task. Their managers and the organization’s top management have to handle this topic and decide. They can stop the use of AI in their area – this happens in companies. However, innovative managers push forward anyhow. They even ignore furious sales staff or navigate and circumvent the issues, for example, by initiating a direct online sales channel.

#### Organizational Impact

How does AI impact employees in the sales organization if AI takes over scoring customers in and for sales and marketing? First, assigning scores is nothing new. Marketing and sales professionals have been doing this for decades. AI revolutionizes **how to calculate scores and who** executes the task. It does not base anymore on the gut feeling of a marketing professional, who, based on 30 years of experience, really, really knows that men between 35 and 55 are the ideal customers. The modern form of scoring bases on AI, incorporating as much information as possible such as age, gender, buying history, or clicks on products and ads in the webshop.

When AI takes over the scoring, this impacts the **sales management** organization. The IT department and its software solutions create the lead lists of whom to call to sell a particular product from now on. The sales management can shift its focus away from playing around in Excel to higher-value tasks such as designing campaigns and understanding to whom to sell brand-new products and services.

The impact on the **sales staff** depends on the detailed business model. Is there a deep personal relationship? Does the (time-consuming) personal relationship translate into adequate extra revenues? Do the sales reps consider customers to be “their” customers and is this belief backed by reality? For example, in (outbound) call-centers, AI-generated lead lists do not change how agents work. As before, they get a list of (potential) clients they have to contact. The only difference is that they should close more deals because the customers on the AI-generated list contain more customers likely to buy. Thus, they generate higher revenues (or reach the previous goals in less time). Sales staff with a **personal relationship** will see some change because AI complements their personal understanding of their customer with statistically derived insights. Especially in the latter case, the success depends on a combination of IT and data science and an organizational transformation.

### Insights for Product Strategies

AI brings not only quick wins for sales organizations on a tactical or operational level. It also provides strategic insights, for example, for product and service managers. We exemplify the latter aspect of generating strategic insights by looking at the benefits of AI for product management and sales and at the methodology behind it.

#### Identifying the Business Challenge

Increasing revenues and profits is part of the DNA of every successful company. Product managers are eager to find new ways to boost sales for their portfolio. The previous section already presented one specific example of how to push sales. Here, we take a broader, more holistic perspective: the Ansoff Matrix (Figure [1-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5), left). TheAnsoff Matrix covers the best-known growth strategies to increase sales. Market penetration is the most straightforward strategy to implement: selling more of the existing products to the existing customer base – the approach presented in the previous section about operational efficiency (Figure [1-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5), middle).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484278246/files/images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.png" alt="../images/516372_1_En_1_Chapter/516372_1_En_1_Fig5_HTML.png" height="646" width="1717"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-5</p></figcaption></figure>

Product development is another growth strategy: selling new products to an existing customer base. For example, many years ago, banks launched credit cards and sold them to their existing customer base. It is not realistic to get such product ideas from AI. However, it can help matching customer segments and products to identify niches.

This approach does not apply an AI model to predict who signs up for a credit card. This strategy requires **analyzing the AI model itself**. Potential insights from the model can be:

* Teenagers do not have a credit card.
* Adults in low-income households seldom have one.
* Retired persons often have no credit card. If they have one, they use it infrequently.

These insights help product managers to launch product innovations. In this example, the bank has unserved customer segments, for example, teenagers to whom the bank must not grant loans and adults with high default risk. The product manager needs a new product because the existing offering is not suitable for these customer segments. We all know the solution: prepaid credit cards. It looks like a credit card, but you can only spend as much money as you put on the card beforehand. For retired persons skeptical about the risks when paying with a credit card, an assurance for cyber fraud is an option. Thus, AI can help with its model to shape and develop new products (Figure [1-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5), right/B). Another outcome of such an analysis can be that the customer base of similar products overlaps. In such a case, product managers might want to restructure their product portfolio because the products cannibalize each other and each product has fixed- costs.

An AI model helps as well for a market-development growth strategy. Suppose a product manager analyzes the AI model and can characterize potential buyers (e.g., over 30, no kids, no cat, potentially a dog). With this knowledge, he can contact market research or direct marketing companies with address databases. They might provide lists of persons matching the criteria, making them likely potential new customers (Figure [1-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5), right/C).

Figure [1-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6) illustrates the mechanics of how to use an AI model for insights from a procedural side. The idea is to check whether a defined product or market strategy and observed customer behavior match. If not, this means there is an opportunity for growth when readjusting the product and market strategy and checking again.

#### AI and Analytics vs. Excel

When AI project managers or data scientists explain to another team the wonderful new world of AI that revolutionizes this other team’s work, they must never forget one truth: the rest of the organization worked well before the AI professionals got involved. Thus, AI professionals might have to explain over and over again why AI-generated lists outperform manual Excel-based approaches. I remember vividly a statement from a bank’s marketing specialist who told me: an apprentice generates a prospects list within two to three days with Excel. They do not need AI.

When looking at product management, comparing sales strategy and sales reality is nothing new. However, especially analytical or statistical methods allow for an enhanced understanding compared to the traditional manual Excel approach. **Excel** works for 20 or 30 criteria. It is suitable for manually validating the impact of one or two of these criteria such as gender or age, or both. Such simple hypotheses for manual validation could be “Only customers under 25 order energy drinks” or “Families with children like to buy pink bed linen with unicorns and flamingos.”

**AI** brings two improvements. First, there is **no need for a hypothesis** of what might be the most relevant attributes to be validated manually. Instead, the AI algorithms look at all provided attributes during the learning and model creation and identifies the genuinely relevant attributes. Second, AI algorithms work even for **thousands of attributes**, whereas a human working with an Excel sheet fails when confronted with that level of complexity.

Especially complex relationships are hard to understand for humans. How long does it take with Excel to figure out three customer groups? One group consists of male customers under 25, one of the wealthy females in the suburbs, aged 30 to 40, and the third and last group is of seniors over 60 in villages with dogs. Such advanced insights help product managers and marketing experts to identify and model their **personas**. Personas are groups of (potential) buyers or product users sharing similar demographics and, depending on the context, motivations.

An example from the banking world: A bank wants to understand why customers in corporate banking end their relationship. They realize: The bank advisors sold a newly launched product quite well to their commercial clients. That is the knowledge generated using analytics. Drawing the conclusion, judging, and deciding is the task of the bankers. They have to figure out why customers left after buying a well-selling product. They learned that the bank advisors pushed the product onto their clients whether it was suitable or not. Customers felt tricked and terminated their banking relationship. This churn use case example illustrates how data-driven companies benefit because they get insights no one could have asked for. And those insights help companies move ahead of their competitors. Nobody saw the relationship between the well-sold product and customer running away – the AI model made it obvious.

#### Understanding the AI Project Deliverables and Methodology

How do data scientists and AI projects generate strategic insights for product managers, as discussed in the previous section? This challenge has many facets. The starting point is always real-world data serving as training to create an AI model. For the example of a sales scenario in Figure [1-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7), this is the table “Sales Data used for Model Training.” The more data, attributes, or parameters, the better. Crucial is the column that contains the expected output or prediction. In the example, this is the “Yes/No” column. Who might buy – this is the ultimate prediction the model should make.

The data scientists apply learning algorithms to this training data, aiming for creating a predictive model. The model is the base for strategic and tactical insights. Tactical insights are customers that might have a high probability of buying the product. To this aim, data scientists apply the predictive model to customers who have not been contacted by sales reps yet. They get a score for each customer – this is table “Lead List” – of how likely they will buy the product if approached. The score helps to prioritize whom to call.

The data scientist looks at the model for getting strategic insights. The AI model contains the information that middle-income customers have a strong affiliation with the product. Other indicators for potentially product-affine customers are being male, having a high income, or paying for a banking bundle.

### AI-Driven Innovation in Fashion

The typical AI bread-and-butter business is identifying upselling or cross-selling opportunities and understanding customer characteristics. However, AI can be cool and trendy – or at least data scientists can help others become and stay fashionable and stylish. The fashion and especially the fast-fashion business seems to be just about finding cheap factories for manufacturing in the Far East and spending big on marketing campaigns. However, AI is crucial in fashion and penetrated many critical functions than, for example, in the highly digitized world of banking.

The massive usage of AI comes as no surprise when asking yourself whether you would put the same designs and the exact same sizes on stock in the stores in North Dakota and your flagship stores in Milan and Paris. Do your customers have the same fashion sense everywhere? Should you price your items the same around the globe? The questions are provocative – at least if you live in North Dakota – but H\&M lost much money when shipping similar items to all its stores. They failed to sell enough clothes at undiscounted prices as planned, which significantly impacted their revenues and margin. Thus, H\&M invested in “localization.” AI predicts which store’s customers are most interested in which fashion piece and route their garments accordingly. The predictions base on point-of-sales data and information about their loyalty club members (and where they shop).

However, the fashion industry’s value chain is longer and more complex, and AI can help in various other steps as well (see Figure [1-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8)). **Trend scouting** reflects that big brands and fashion retailers have only limited influence today. The fashion shows in Paris and Italy do not dictate trends as in the 20th century. Influencers and social media curate new trends. Understanding these trends either requires manually looking and classifying fashion photos and videos found everywhere – or letting AI determine trends by categorizing images, for example, for garment style or color. When it comes to designing garments, Tommy Hilfiger, together with IBM and the Fashion Institute of Technology College in Manhattan, run a joint project. They used AI technology, Tommy Hilfiger’s product library, and pictures from runways to enable students to create new fashion designs based on the brand’s aesthetic. It is unclear whether they want to incorporate such ideas into their fashion design methodology. Still, the example illustrates one important point: data and AI can also innovate **creative processes**. Similarly, H\&M sold a Data Dress. Its design is the result of the person’s life and context, such as the weather. These influencing parameters determine the choice of color, material, and additional details to make a really customer-specific dress.

Next in the value chain is estimating the sales success of products, and **ordering** the matching amount of pieces is a typical prediction question for AI. Once it is clear which items to assign to which store, the next step is pricing the pieces. Which price are customers willing to pay? How many pieces do we estimate to sell for which price? H\&M reports benefits of using AI – and especially of using a combination of AI and final human judgment.

Finally, there are client-facing functionalities such as apps, emails, or push messages. They help implement the already mentioned use cases such as upselling and cross-selling or identifying shopper groups and characteristics. While this is standard across industries, the AI-based Tommy Hilfiger **brand and shopping experience** is an exciting high-tech idea: “see-now-buy-now.” Customers can buy fashion directly during a fashion show when models present the garments on the runway. Similarly, an app allows customers to identify fashion pieces on camera snapshots and provides the opportunity to buy them directly in the online shop. It is an inspirational eye-opener even for non-fashionados to see in how many ways AI innovates the fashion industry. It should motivate business executives and data scientists in other industry sectors to look around with open eyes to identify innovative opportunities in their daily work as well.

### Business Intelligence and AI

All the previous examples about sales and product management or fast fashion exemplified how AI innovates companies. When managers want to start a similar program, the first question is: Who will run the project? Do we have a qualified team with relevant experience?

Most companies have data warehouse (DWH) and business intelligence (BI) teams. These teams know the company data very well. They run a platform with at least all necessary technical features for the first AI use cases. However, I was first surprised when I noticed that many companies – especially medium-sized organizations – establish separate AI programs and data science teams instead of enhancing the DWH or BI team with data science know-how.

This phenomenon highlights: just having the best and brightest experts, even if they and their software solutions match the business needs, is not enough. Organizational compatibility is essential. The following four reasons prove that. They illustrate why companies establish AI teams separately in addition to BI and DWH teams:

1.  1\.

    BI teams often focus on summary **reports**, not on generating additional knowledge and insights (see the discussion about data, information, and knowledge reflected in Figure [1-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-ai-in/9781484278246/html/516372\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). Not every reporting-focused BI team can reinvent itself (and has the funding for that).

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    The **sponsors** differ. Often, the funding for a data warehouse comes from controlling or marketing and sales. Thus, the teams have to deliver results valuable for their sponsors. In contrast to data science teams, they cannot shift many engineers to projects outside their sponsor’s interest area.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Data warehousing teams often focus on developing thoroughly tested and well-specified solutions. This cautious approach is necessary, for example, for regulatory reports. The expectations in AI differ. Suppose the business needs **quick answers** for a one-time-only question that is not asked again. Not all data warehousing teams are ready for that.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Small data warehousing teams are often busy keeping the systems and all feeds up and running. They have to ensure a smooth daily, weekly, or monthly delivery of business-critical reports. Such teams are strong in **operations** and engineering but miss know-how for more advanced and mathematically challenging AI tasks.

    &#x20;

These are four aspects organizations should consider before assigning AI-related responsibilities to an existing DWH or BI team. However, as we see in later chapters, a data warehouse is an excellent data source for data scientists. An existing DWH speeds up many AI projects. Thus, it is essential for an organization that BI and DWH teams and data scientists understand that they complement each other. They do not compete.

### Summary

At the end of this first chapter, I want to summarize the main points quickly:

* Data-driven companies base their decisions on facts and data rather than on experience and seniority. AI helps in extracting actionable insights from large and complex data sets.
* The four benefits of AI are informational (providing additional information), transactional (making something better or cheaper), strategic (impacting a company’s or product’s standing on the market), and transformational (paving the road for future improvements).
* AI is about creating models. These models have a tactical benefit for the organization. They can predict individual behavior, for example, whether a person is likely to buy a phone. The models provide strategic insights, too, such as identifying the characteristics of typical buyers.
* AI helps in optimizing single tasks such as cross- and upselling. Alternatively, AI can enable transformations of business models, such as is illustrated with the fashion industry example.
* Many companies have DWH and BI teams that could take over at least more straightforward AI projects. However, separate AI teams are crucial when service models, funding, and governance structures differ.

With this knowledge, we are ready to look at how to run AI projects and deliver innovation. Just be warned and remember the old proverb: “We admire what we do not understand.” After the next chapter, you understand how data scientists work and how you can improve projects. So, AI will be less magical for you afterward!
