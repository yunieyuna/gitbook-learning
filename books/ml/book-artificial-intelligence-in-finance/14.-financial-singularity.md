The managers decide what the machines need to do, and the machines do the job.”

Can AI-based competition in the financial industry lead to a financial singularity? This is the main question that this final chapter discusses. It starts with [“Notions and Definitions”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#notions\_definitions), which defines expressions such as _financial singularity_ and _artificial financial intelligence_ (AFI). [“What Is at Stake?”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#at\_stake) illustrates what, in terms of potential wealth accumulation, is at stake in the race for an AFI. [“Paths to Financial Singularity”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#paths\_to\_fs) considers, against the background of [Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch02.html#superintelligence), paths that might lead to an AFI. [“Orthogonal Skills and Resources”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#orthogonality) argues that there are a number of resources that are instrumental and orthogonal to the goal of creating an AFI. Anybody involved in the race for an AFI will compete for these resources. Finally, [“Star Trek or Star Wars”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#star\_trek\_wars) considers whether an AFI, as discussed in this chapter, will benefit only a few people or humanity as a whole.

## Notions and Definitions

The expression _financial singularity_ dates back at least to the 2015 blog post by Shiller. In this post, Shiller writes:

> Will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy? More fundamentally, is the day approaching when, thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers, financial markets really do become perfect, and we can just sit back, relax, and assume that all assets are priced correctly?
>
> This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity, analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity, when computers replace human intelligence. The financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program, because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system.

A bit more generally, one could define the _financial singularity_ as the point in time from which computers and algorithms begin to take over control of finance and the whole financial industry, including banks, asset managers, exchanges, and so on, with humans taking a back seat as managers, supervisors, and controllers, if anything.

On the other hand, one could define the financial singularity—in the spirit of this book’s focus—as the point in time from which _a trading bot exists that shows a consistent capability to predict movements in financial markets at superhuman and super-institutional levels, as well as with unprecedented accuracy_. In that sense, such a trading bot would be characterized as an artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) instead of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence (see [Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch02.html#superintelligence)).

It can be assumed that it is much easier to build such an AFI in the form of a trading bot than an AGI or even a superintelligence. This holds true for AlphaZero in the same way, as it is easier to build an AI agent that is superior to any human being or any other agent in playing the game of Go. Therefore, even if it is not yet clear whether there will ever be an AI agent that qualifies as an AGI or superintelligence, it is in any case much more likely that a trading bot will emerge that qualifies as an ANI or AFI.

In what follows, the focus lies on a trading bot that qualifies as an AFI to keep the discussion as specific as possible and embedded in the context of this book.

## What Is at Stake?

The pursuit of an AFI might be challenging and exciting in and of itself. However, as is usual in finance, not too many initiatives are driven by altruistic motives; rather, most are driven by the financial incentives (that is, hard cash). But what exactly is at stake in the race to build an AFI? This cannot be answered with certainty or generality, but some simple calculations can shed light on the question.

To understand how valuable it is to have an AFI as compared to inferior trading strategies, consider the following benchmarks:

Bull strategy

A trading strategy that goes long only on a financial instrument in the expectation of rising prices.

Random strategy

A trading strategy that chooses a long or short position randomly for a given financial instrument.

Bear strategy

A trading strategy that goes short only on a financial instrument in the expectation of falling prices.

These benchmark strategies shall be compared to AFIs with the following success characteristics:

X% top

The AFI gets the top X% up and down movements correct, with the remaining market movements being predicted randomly.

X% AFI

The AFI gets X% of all randomly chosen market movements correct, with the remaining market movements being predicted randomly.

The following Python code imports the known time series data set with EOD data for a number of financial instruments. The examples to follow rely on five years’ worth of EOD data for a single financial instrument:

```
In [1]: import random
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        from pylab import plt, mpl
        plt.style.use('seaborn')
        mpl.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300
        mpl.rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'

In [2]: url = 'https://hilpisch.com/aiif_eikon_eod_data.csv'

In [3]: raw = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

In [4]: symbol = 'EUR='

In [5]: raw['bull'] = np.log(raw[symbol] / raw[symbol].shift(1))  

In [6]: data = pd.DataFrame(raw['bull']).loc['2015-01-01':]  

In [7]: data.dropna(inplace=True)

In [8]: data.info()
        <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
        DatetimeIndex: 1305 entries, 2015-01-01 to 2020-01-01
        Data columns (total 1 columns):
         #   Column  Non-Null Count  Dtype
        ---  ------  --------------  -----
         0   bull    1305 non-null   float64
        dtypes: float64(1)
        memory usage: 20.4 KB
```

The _bull_ benchmark returns (long only)

With the bull strategy being already defined by the log returns of the base financial instrument, the following Python code specifies the other two benchmark strategies and derives the performances for the AFI strategies. In this context, a number of AFI strategies are considered to illustrate the impact of improvements in the accuracy of the AFI’s predictions:

```
In [9]: np.random.seed(100)

In [10]: data['random'] = np.random.choice([-1, 1], len(data)) * data['bull']  

In [11]: data['bear'] = -data['bull']  

In [12]: def top(t):
             top = pd.DataFrame(data['bull'])
             top.columns = ['top']
             top = top.sort_values('top')
             n = int(len(data) * t)
             top['top'].iloc[:n] = abs(top['top'].iloc[:n])
             top['top'].iloc[n:] = abs(top['top'].iloc[n:])
             top['top'].iloc[n:-n] = np.random.choice([-1, 1],
                             len(top['top'].iloc[n:-n])) * top['top'].iloc[n:-n]
             data[f'{int(t * 100)}_top'] = top.sort_index()

In [13]: for t in [0.1, 0.15]:
             top(t)  

In [14]: def afi(ratio):
             correct = np.random.binomial(1, ratio, len(data))
             random = np.random.choice([-1, 1], len(data))
             strat = np.where(correct, abs(data['bull']), random * data['bull'])
             data[f'{int(ratio * 100)}_afi'] = strat

In [15]: for ratio in [0.51, 0.6, 0.75, 0.9]:
             afi(ratio)  
```

The _X% AFI_ strategy returns

Using the standard vectorized backtesting approach, as introduced in [Chapter 10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch10.html#vectorized\_backtesting) (neglecting transaction costs), it becomes clear what significant increases in the prediction accuracy imply in financial terms. Consider the “90% AFI,” which is not perfect in its predictions but rather lacks any edge in 10% of all cases. The assumed 90% accuracy leads to a gross performance that over five years returns almost 100 times the invested capital (before transaction costs). With 75% accuracy, the AFI would still return almost 50 times the invested capital (see [Figure 14-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch14.html#figure\_fs\_01)). This excludes leverage, which can easily be added in an almost risk-less fashion in the presence of such prediction accuracies:

**Figure 14-1. Gross performance of benchmark and theoretical AFI strategies over time**

The analyses show that quite a lot is at stake, although several simplifying assumptions are of course made. Time plays an important role in this context. Re-implementing the same analyses over a 10-year period makes the numbers even more impressive—almost unimaginable in a trading context. As the following output illustrates for “90% AFI,” the gross return would be more than 16,000 times the invested capital (before transaction costs). The effect of compounding and reinvesting is tremendous:

## Paths to Financial Singularity

The emergence of an AFI would be a rather specific event in a rather specified environment. It is, for example, not necessary to emulate the brain of a human being since AGI or superintelligence is not the major goal. Given that there is no human being who seems to be consistently superior in trading in the financial markets compared to everybody else, it might even be a dead end street, trying to emulate a human brain to arrive at an AFI. There is also no need to worry about embodiment. An AFI can live as software only on an appropriate infrastructure connecting to the required data and trading APIs.

On the other hand, AI seems to be a promising path to an AFI because of the very nature of the problem: take as input large amounts of financial and other data and generate predictions about the future direction of a price movement. This is exactly what the algorithms presented and applied in this book are all about—in particular those that fall in the supervised and reinforcement learning categories.

Another option might be a hybrid of human and machine intelligence. Whereas machines have supported human traders for decades, in many instances the roles have changed. Humans support the machines in trading by providing the ideal environment and up-to-date data, intervening only in extreme situations, and so forth. In many cases, the machines are already completely autonomous in their algorithmic trading decisions. Or as Jim Simons—founder of Renaissance Technologies, one of the most successful and secretive systematic trading hedge funds—puts it: “The only rule is we never override the computer.”

While it is quite unclear which paths might lead to superintelligence, from today’s perspective, it seems most likely that AI might pave the way to the financial singularity and an AFI.

## Orthogonal Skills and Resources

[Chapter 13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch13.html#ai\_based\_competition) discusses the competition for resources in the context of AI-based competition in the financial industry. The four major resources in this context are human resources (experts), algorithms, and software, financial and alternative data, and high-performance hardware. We can add a fifth resource in this context in the form of the capital needed to acquire the other resources.

According to the orthogonality hypothesis, it is sensible and even imperative to acquire such orthogonal skills and resources, which are instrumental no matter how exactly an AFI will be achieved. Financial institutions taking part in the race to build an AFI will try to acquire as many high-quality resources as they can afford and justify to position themselves as advantageously as possible for the point in time at which _the_, or at least _one_, path to an AFI becomes clear.

In a world driven by AI-first finance, such behavior and positioning might make the difference between thriving, merely surviving, or leaving the market. It cannot be excluded that progress could be made much faster than expected. When Nick Bostrom in 2014 predicted that it might take 10 years until an AI could beat the world champion in the game of Go, basically nobody expected that it would happen only two years later. The major driver has been breakthroughs in the application of reinforcement learning to such games, from which other applications still benefit today. Such unforeseen breakthroughs cannot be excluded in finance either.

## Scenarios Before and After

It is safe to assume that every major financial institution around the world and many other nonfinancial entities currently do research and have practical experience with AI applied to finance. However, not all players in the financial industry are positioned equally well to arrive at a trading AFI first. Some, like banks, are rather restricted by regulatory requirements. Others simply follow different business models, such as exchanges. Others, like certain assets managers, focus on providing low-cost, commoditized investment products, such as ETFs, that mimic the performance of broader market indices. In other words, generating alpha is not the major goal for every financial institution.

From an outside perspective, larger hedge funds therefore seem best positioned to make the most out of AI-first finance and AI-powered algorithmic trading. In general, they already have a lot of the required resources important in this field: talented and well-educated people, experience with trading algorithms, and almost limitless access to traditional and alternative data sources, as well as a scalable, professional trading infrastructure. If something is missing, large technology budgets ensure quick and targeted investments.

It is not clear whether there will be one AFI first with others coming later or if several AFIs may emerge at the same time. If several AFIs are present, one could speak of a multipolar or oligopolistic scenario. The AFIs would probably mostly compete against each other, with “non-AFI” players being sidelined. The sponsors of the single projects would strive to gain advantages, however small, because this might allow one AFI to take over completely and finally become a singleton or monopoly.

It is also conceivable that a “winner take all” scenario might prevail from the start. In such a scenario, a single AFI emerges and is able to quickly reach a level of dominance in financial trading that cannot be matched by any other competitor. This could be for several reasons. One reason might be that the first AFI generates returns so impressive that the assets under management swell at a tremendous pace, leading to ever higher budgets that in turn allows it to acquire ever more relevant resources. Another reason might be that the first AFI quickly reaches a size at which its actions can have a market impact—with the ability to manipulate market prices, for instance—such that it becomes the major, or even the only, driving force in financial markets.

Regulation could in theory prevent an AFI from becoming too big or gaining too much market power. The major questions would be if such laws are enforceable in practice and how exactly they would need to be designed to have their desired effects.

## Star Trek or Star Wars

The financial industry, for many people, represents the purest form of capitalism: the industry in which greed drives everything. It has been and is for sure a highly competitive industry, no arguing about that. Trading and investment management in particular are often symbolized by billionaire managers and owners who are willing to bet big and go head-to-head with their rivals in order to land the next mega deal or trade. The advent of AI provides ambitious managers with a rich tool set to push the competition to the next level, as discussed in [Chapter 13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-in/9781492055426/ch13.html#ai\_based\_competition).

However, the question is whether AI-first finance, potentially culminating in an AFI, will lead to financial utopia or dystopia. The systematic, infallible accumulation of wealth could theoretically serve only a few people, or it could potentially serve humanity. Unfortunately, it is to be assumed that only the sponsors of the project leading to an AFI will directly benefit from the type of AFI imagined in this chapter. This is because such an AFI would only generate profits by trading in the financial markets and not by inventing new products, solving important problems, or growing businesses and industries. In other words, an AFI that merely trades in the financial markets to generate profits is taking part in a zero-sum game and does not directly increase the distributable wealth.

One could argue that, for example, pension funds investing in a fund managed by the AFI would also benefit from its exceptional returns. But this would again only benefit a certain group and not humanity as a whole. It would also be in question whether the sponsors of a successful AFI project would be willing to open up to outside investors. A good example in this regard is the Medallion fund, managed by Renaissance Technologies and one of the best-performing investment vehicles in history. Renaissance closed Medallion, which is essentially run exclusively by machines, to outside investors in 1993. Its stellar performance for sure would have attracted large amounts of additional assets. However, specific considerations, such as the capacity of certain strategies, play a role in this context, and similar considerations might also apply to an AFI.

Therefore, whereas one could expect a superintelligence to help overcome fundamental problems faced by humanity as a whole—serious diseases, environmental problems, unknown threats from outer space, and so forth—an AFI more probably leads to more inequality and fiercer competition in the markets. Instead of a _Star Trek_–like world, characterized by equality and inexhaustible resources, it cannot be excluded that an AFI might rather lead to a _Star Wars_–like world, characterized by intensive trade wars and fights over available resources. At the time of this writing, global trade wars, such as the one between the US and China, seem more intense than ever, and technology and AI are important battlegrounds.

## Conclusions

This chapter takes a high-level perspective and discusses the concepts of financial singularity and artificial financial intelligence. AFI is an ANI that would lack many of the capabilities and characteristics of a superintelligence. An AFI could rather be compared to AlphaZero, which is an ANI for playing board games such as chess or Go. An AFI would excel at the game of trading financial instruments. Of course, in financial trading, a lot more is at stake compared to playing board games.

Similar to AlphaZero, AI is more likely to pave the way to an AFI as compared to alternative paths, such as the emulation of the human brain. Even if the path is not yet fully visible, and although one cannot know for sure how far single projects have progressed already, there are a number of instrumental resources that are important no matter which path will prevail: experts, algorithms, data, hardware, and capital. Large and successful hedge funds seem best positioned to win the race for an AFI.

Even if it might prove impossible to create an AFI as sketched in this chapter, the systematic introduction of AI to finance will certainly spur innovation and in many cases intensify competition in the industry. Rather than being a fad, AI is a trend that finally will lead to a paradigm shift in the industry.
