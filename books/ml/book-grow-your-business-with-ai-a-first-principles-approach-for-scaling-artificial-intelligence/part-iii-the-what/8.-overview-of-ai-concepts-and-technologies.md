# 8. Overview of AI Concepts and Technologies

Welcome to Chapter [8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml), where we will embark on a journey through the core components of AI models, their connection to the larger ecosystem of AI technologies, and the paramount importance of first principles in AI model development.

We already saw in Chapter [5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml) the core components of AI:

1.  a.

    Machine learning algorithms

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    Data (structured and unstructured)

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    &#x20;
4.  d.

    &#x20;

In this chapter we are going to go deeper on the first core component, how to think about machine learning/AI algorithms or models. Consider the development of AI models. A First Principles perspective compels us to focus on the foundational aspects of models – data, features, architecture, parameters, training, and evaluation – rather than merely using pre-packaged algorithms or black-box solutions.

An excellent example of First Principles thinking in AI is the development of the transformer architecture for natural language processing. Instead of trying to improve existing recurrent neural networks, researchers went back to the First Principles of sequence learning and realized that attention mechanisms could be more effective for understanding the dependencies between words in a sentence. This led to the development of models like BERT and GPT, which have revolutionized natural language processing.

### Core Components of AI Models

In Chapter [5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml), we established AI’s primary objective: to create models or algorithms capable of accurate predictions for unfamiliar inputs. This goal is achieved by developing systems that can extrapolate patterns within the training data to deliver precise decisions in novel situations. The key in real-world scenarios is **adaptability**; the AI must respond to dynamic data and make informed decisions independently.

The ultimate objective is to find an optimal model that, based on its training dataset, can accurately predict outcomes in new situations. In essence, an AI model is a mathematical function making predictions based on data. We dissect this function using a First Principles approach, examining its core components: inputs, architecture, parameters, training, and evaluation.

We will go now into the major steps of the AI modeling process flow, as per Figure [8-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2).

#### Data Inputs: Data and Features

Data is the lifeblood of an AI model. The quality and relevance of the data directly impacts the model’s performance. AI models can handle various types of data, including numerical, categorical, text, and image data. The source of the data can be internal (e.g., company databases) or external (e.g., public datasets, third-party data providers).

Tip&#x20;

Contrary to popular “best” practices from some inexperienced data practitioners, focus on the data tends to bring much bigger improvements to your model performance as opposed to spending time with the modeling aspects.

We will cover this very important topic in more detail in the chapter about data monetization and open data. Table [8-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1) expands how different types of data are indeed better suited for different kinds of AI models. Numerical data are often best modeled using regression algorithms or neural networks. Categorical data excel with classification methods, such as decision trees. Text data are commonly processed using natural language processing (NLP) models, while image data are ideally suited for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).Table 8-1&#x20;

Examples of different data types and suitable AI models

| Data type   | Example                           | Suitable AI model      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Numerical   | Customer age, income              | Linear regression      |
| Categorical | Customer gender, product category | Decision trees         |
| Text        | Customer reviews                  | NLP models (BERT, GPT) |
| Image       | Product images                    | CNNs                   |

**Features** are specific, measurable characteristics or properties of the data that the model uses to make predictions. Feature engineering involves selecting the most relevant features and transforming them into a format that the model can understand.

#### Model Architecture

At its core, an AI model learns patterns from data and uses these patterns to make predictions or decisions. It’s like a recipe that transforms inputs (data) into an output (prediction) using a defined set of steps (the model’s architecture and parameters).

For simplicity, we will focus on a type of AI, machine learning. However, most of the concepts explained here can be extrapolated to other types of AI.

**Machine Learning from First Principles**

Machine learning comprises three primary components:

* **Model**: This makes predictions or recognitions.
* **Parameters**: These are factors the model utilizes to make its decisions.
* **Learner**: This adjusts parameters and consequently the model, by evaluating the discrepancies between predictions and actual outcomes.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_8_Chapter/605840_1_En_8_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="815" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 8-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

We can see how the pieces fit together in Figure [8-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3). To illustrate the overall flow, let’s consider a fitness coach trying to predict optimal exercise duration for maximum calorie burn. The coach decides to leverage machine learning.

**Constructing the Model**

The initial model, provided by the coach, assumes exercising for 2 hours results in burning 800 calories. The parameters for this model are hours spent exercising and the calories burned, established as follows:

* 1 hour = 400 calories
* 2 hours = 800 calories
* 3 hours = 1200 calories
* 4 hours = 1600 calories
* 5 hours = 2000 calories

The model uses a mathematical formula to derive a trend line based on these parameters.

**Feeding Initial Data**

With the model in place, the coach inputs real-world data – calories burned by four different individuals and the corresponding hours they exercised. The observed data does not entirely align with the model, which leads to the learning phase of machine learning.

**Learning Phase**

The data inputted is often called the “training set” or “training data.” The learner component uses it to train the model for more accurate predictions. The learner studies the discrepancy between the model and the actual data, and then adjusts the initial assumptions. For instance:

* 1 hour = 500 calories
* 2 hours = 1000 calories
* 3 hours = 1500 calories
* 4 hours = 2000 calories
* 5 hours = 2500 calories

The revised model now suggests burning 1,000 calories would require 2 hours of exercise.

**Iteration Process**

The system reruns with a new set of data and compares the observed calories burned with the revised model. The learner readjusts the parameters for a more accurate prediction. This iterative process repeats until the model accurately predicts calories burned based on hours of exercise.

This gradual, iterative process of minimizing the error between the prediction and the actual data (sometimes called “ground truth”) is referred to as **“gradient descent”** in machine learning, similar to carefully descending a steep hill. The gradual adjustments minimize the risk of drastic errors in the model.

While the math behind this might be relatively straightforward for those versed in calculus, the real challenge lies in computing power. However, as computer capabilities evolve, complex machine learning processes are becoming increasingly attainable.

**What Model?**

The guiding principle behind creating useful machine learning models is eloquently captured by George Box’s statement, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” It underscores the reality that no model is flawless, but the objective is to find ones that are precise and beneficial for predicting new data.

A machine learning model aims to fit a function to a given dataset, enabling predictions for new data. Two popular approaches to this process are **Bayesian and frequentist methods**. Bayesian approaches incorporate prior information to enhance predictions, while frequentist methods rely solely on the provided data. Bayesian methods can offer superior accuracy but are more complex to implement.

As we structure our models, we need to be mindful of principles such as **Ockham’s razor** and the no-free lunch principle. Ockham’s razor suggests that the simplest explanation is typically the correct one, while the **no-free lunch** principle posits that no single machine learning algorithm is optimal for all problems. It is thus crucial to match the algorithm to the specific data characteristics.

Two key statistical concepts utilized in machine learning are the normal distribution and the difference between Bayesian and frequentist perspectives:

* **The normal distribution**, also referred to as the **Gaussian distribution**, is a bell-shaped probability distribution symmetric about its mean. It is commonly used in machine learning to model continuous data, such as physical measurements or financial data.
* **The Bayesian and frequentist perspectives** represent two different schools of thought in statistics. Frequentists interpret probability as the long-run frequency of events, while Bayesians view it as a measure of belief or certainty. Frequentist methods are computationally more straightforward and easier to implement, whereas Bayesian methods accommodate more complex modeling techniques, incorporate prior knowledge, and deliver a full probability distribution as the outcome.

In machine learning, no one-size-fits-all approach exists. The choice of method depends on the problem at hand and available data. For example, if prior knowledge about the data is available, Bayesian methods can be powerful. However, the essential takeaway is that machine learning models, while never perfect, are invaluable tools in making precise and practical predictions from data. Choosing a model architecture involves trade-offs. For example, more complex architectures may capture more complex patterns but risk overfitting the data. First Principles thinking involves balancing the need for model complexity with the need for generalizability.

#### Model Parameters

This step of the process involves selecting the following:

* **Parameters**: They are the parts of the model that are learned from the data.
* **Weights and biases**: They are parameters in a neural network. Weights determine the importance of a feature, while biases allow the model to fit the data more flexibly.
* **Hyperparameters**: Selection and optimization, such as the learning rate or the number of layers in a neural network, are not learned from the data but are set prior to training. Selecting and tuning hyperparameters is a crucial step in building an effective model.

Once the parameters have been set, **cross-validation** is a technique to assess a model’s performance, and it partitions the training data into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set, a process repeated several times to compute an average accuracy.

#### Model Training

Model training involves using data to adjust the model’s parameters:

* **Cost function and optimization**: The cost function measures how well the model’s predictions match the actual values. During training, the goal is to minimize this cost function using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent.
* **Backpropagation and gradient descent**: Backpropagation is the method used to calculate the gradient of the cost function, which is then used in the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the model’s weights and biases. Essentially, it involves calculating the error at the output and distributing it back through the network to update the weights and biases.

#### Model Evaluation and Validation

After a model is trained, it needs to be evaluated and validated to ensure it performs well on unseen data:

* **Understanding evaluation metrics**: They measure the performance of an AI model. The choice of metric depends on the specific task at hand. For instance, accuracy is often used for classification tasks, while mean squared error is common for regression tasks.
* **Overfitting, underfitting, and model generalization**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Underfitting is when the model is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. Striking a balance between the two is key to model generalization, that is, the model’s ability to perform well on unseen data. To prevent overfitting, we employ regularization techniques, which apply a penalty to the model’s cost function, making the model less complex and less prone to overfitting.

To summarize, a First Principles approach to model development involves

* Understanding the basic components of an AI model
* Recognizing the importance of data quality and relevance
* Balancing the complexity and generalizability of the model
* Being thoughtful about parameter and hyperparameter selection
* Ensuring robust model evaluation and validation

We will go in more details for some of the most popular models in later chapters.

As we discussed in earlier chapters, there are many taxonomies to classify the different AI algorithms, depending on the criteria being used. Figure [8-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) provides one of those taxonomies, but as mentioned, there are multiples, and it is recommended to get familiar with a few different taxonomies, so you can get accustomed with the different AI models and how they can be applied to different real-life scenarios.

The following list has a brief description of the most popular ones. In the next few chapters, we will go into their details:

We will explore in later chapters some of the most popular one and how to select the most appropriate one for your specific project. In the next section, we will explore the various AI platforms and tools available for implementing these models.

### AI Platforms and Tools

In this section, we will explore the various platforms and tools available for implementing AI models from a high-level point of view. Chapter [16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_16\_Chapter.xhtml) will go into a lot of more detail. From cloud-based platforms to programming languages and libraries, understanding the ecosystem of AI tools is crucial for effective implementation and scalability.

From the First Principles point of view, the core components are

* AI platforms
* Programming languages.
* Libraries: for ML algorithms, data visualization, and deep learning

Let’s expand all these core components:

* **AI platforms**: They provide the infrastructure and services needed to develop, train, and deploy machine learning models. They often come with pre-built models, data storage, processing capabilities, and tools for monitoring and managing AI applications.
  * **Cloud-based AI platforms** (AWS, GCP, Azure): They offer comprehensive suites of machine learning services, including pre-trained models, autoML, custom model training, and deployment services. They also provide scalability and flexibility, allowing you to easily adjust resources as your needs change.
  * **Open-source platforms** (TensorFlow, PyTorch): They provide flexible, extensible environments for developing and training custom machine learning models. They have a large community of developers, extensive documentation, and are widely used in research and development.

  * **For model** **visualization and interpretability** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, SHAP): They help in understanding and interpreting data and model performance. SHAP and similar libraries provide tools for interpreting complex models, shedding light on how input features contribute to model predictions.

When selecting tools, a First Principles approach involves considering the specific requirements of your project, such as the complexity of the model, the size and type of data, the computational resources available, and the need for scalability and interpretability. Table [8-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3) shows an evaluation of popular AI platforms and tools.Table 8-3&#x20;

Comparison of AI platforms and tools

| Tool type                | Examples                   | Pros                                                                         | Cons                                                         |

Selecting the right tools and platforms for your AI needs is a crucial decision that can significantly impact your project’s efficiency and outcome. It’s not only about picking the most popular or advanced tools but choosing those that best fit your specific needs and constraints.

While cloud-based platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure offer scalability and wide-ranging services, they may not always provide the level of customization you might need for a particular project. On the other hand, open-source platforms like TensorFlow and PyTorch offer flexibility and customization but require a steeper learning curve.

Python, R, and Julia, the popular programming languages for AI, have their strengths: Python for its extensive library support, R for statistical analysis, and Julia for its speed. However, the choice of language depends on the specific use case and the skill set of your team.

Libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn are fundamental for data manipulation, while deep learning requires more specialized libraries like Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and interpretability libraries like SHAP, help in understanding and interpreting your models, but can require significant coding and statistical understanding.

In a First Principles approach, all these factors – the project requirements, the available resources, the trade-offs involved – should be considered carefully to select the tools that most effectively serve your AI project’s goals.

### Takeaways

In this chapter, we have taken a deep dive into the various facets of AI, its core components, and the tools that power its operations.

Recap of key points and implications for businesses:

* **First Principles in AI**: The first principles approach, which involves breaking down complex systems into their fundamental components and understanding their underlying principles, is central to AI model development.
  * **Do** apply first principles thinking in AI model development: This approach encourages critical thinking and fosters innovation. It can lead to solutions that are more robust and less susceptible to pitfalls.
  * **Don’t** blindly follow trends or popular methods without understanding the underlying principles. This could lead to sub-optimal solutions and missed opportunities for innovation.
* **Choice of AI models**: We discussed a variety of AI models, from supervised and unsupervised learning models to neural networks and generative AI. Each model type has its strengths and use cases. Businesses must understand these differences and choose the model that best fits their specific needs and context.
  * **Do** choose the AI model that best fits your business needs and context. It’s essential to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model type and how they align with your specific goals.
  * **Don’t** choose a model solely based on its popularity or complexity. A complex model isn’t always better. Sometimes, a simpler model can provide equally good, if not better, results.
* **AI platforms and tools**: Selecting the appropriate tools and platforms can significantly impact your AI project’s efficiency and outcome. The choice between cloud-based platforms (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) and open-source platforms (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) should be made based on your specific requirements, resources, and constraints.
  * **Do** select your AI tools and platforms based on your specific needs, resources, and constraints. Consider factors like scalability, customization, budget and the skill set of your team.
  * **Don’t** choose tools just because they are popular or advanced. Not all advanced tools will be suitable for your specific needs. Always align your tool selection with your project requirements and team’s capabilities.

AI, with its vast potential, can significantly boost your business’s growth and efficiency. However, leveraging its power requires a deep understanding of its concepts, components, and tools. Adhering to first principles in AI model development can guide you through this complex landscape, leading to more effective and robust AI implementations.
