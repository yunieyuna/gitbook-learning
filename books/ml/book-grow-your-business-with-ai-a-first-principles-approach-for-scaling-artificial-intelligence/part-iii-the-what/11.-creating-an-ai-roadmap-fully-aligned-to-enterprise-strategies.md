# 11. Creating an AI Roadmap Fully Aligned to Enterprise Strategies

In the era of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has swiftly emerged as a potent catalyst for business growth and innovation. From automating routine tasks to delivering personalized experiences and generating unprecedented insights, AI is fundamentally reshaping how we conduct business. However, reaping the full benefits of this powerful technology is not as simple as adopting the latest AI applications. It requires a _**strategic, systematic, and deeply ingrained approach**_ – this is where the First Principles methodology comes into play.

We explored in earlier chapters First Principles applied to AI – and went into the details of all the different areas that needed to be addressed. By applying this approach to AI opportunity identification, you can ensure a thorough and strategic exploration of potential AI applications, while avoiding the pitfalls of short-term thinking or reliance on existing solutions. This methodology allows you to think creatively and systematically, ensuring that you uncover AI opportunities that align with your company’s unique needs and objectives. It also allows businesses to ensure that their AI strategy is rooted in a deep understanding of their unique context, needs, and capabilities, rather than generic industry trends or competitor benchmarks. This makes it possible to identify AI opportunities that are truly aligned with their business and data strategies and can deliver maximum value.

But why is it so important to identify AI opportunities and develop a cohesive AI strategy? Simply put, AI has the potential to deliver significant competitive advantages and value creation opportunities, but only if it is leveraged strategically.

Developing a cohesive AI strategy using the First Principles approach also ensures that AI implementation is not a disjointed, one-off initiative, but a well-integrated part of the company’s overall business strategy. For example, a leading bank might identify AI opportunities in credit risk prediction, customer service automation, and fraud detection. By integrating these initiatives into a cohesive strategy, the bank can ensure that its AI investments support each other and align with its broader business goals. Indeed, common infrastructure and operations cost can be shared across these projects, and data can be shared between these individual projects to even create new initiatives – with associated business benefits.

Connecting AI opportunities to the wider enterprise strategy is one of the most challenging tasks. My goal is to empower you to analyze your business systematically, uncover potential AI applications, prioritize them based on feasibility and impact, and implement them strategically for maximum value creation.

In an ideal world – and some companies achieve this – there should be only one enterprise strategy, which reflects all aspects: data, AI, technology, business, etc. However, the reality is that large companies will have several strategies, often completely separated. During my career, I have seen many (probably too many) “technology roadmaps” which only discuss software stacks, cloud providers, and a lot of technical terms and barely mentioned the overall business strategies. Statements like “my tech strategy is to move all our data centers to X cloud provider” are completely divorced from business outcomes and therefore are very risky – they will have associated a relatively large tech bill with little demonstrable business benefits. I will provide techniques to ensure those different potential AI initiatives are as aligned as realistically possible.

The synergy between AI, data, and business strategies is crucial for organizations seeking to capitalize on the benefits of AI. AI relies heavily on data to learn and make predictions. Consequently, an effective data strategy is essential for providing AI systems with the necessary high-quality data to perform optimally. Furthermore, a robust business strategy ensures that AI initiatives align with the organization’s broader goals and objectives.

To fully reap the benefits of AI, organizations must align their AI, data, and business strategies, ensuring that they work in harmony toward a common goal. The following Table [11-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1) illustrates the key elements that need to be considered when aligning these strategies.Table 11-1&#x20;

Key elements for aligning AI, data, and business strategies

| AI strategy         | Data strategy             | Business strategy         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Identify use cases  | Ensure data quality       | Set strategic objectives  |
| Select AI models    | Manage data access        | Prioritize AI initiatives |
| Plan implementation | Enable data sharing       | Allocate resources        |
| Monitor performance | Implement data governance | Monitor progress          |

The integration of AI, data, and business strategies is vital for organizations seeking to drive growth and innovation. Organizations can successfully leverage AI to achieve their objectives and gain a competitive edge in the market, ensuring they understand the importance of developing a cohesive AI strategy and recognizing the interconnectedness of AI, data, and business strategies. This chapter will delve deeper into the process of aligning these strategies and provide a framework for systematically exploring AI benefits across various business areas.

### A Systematic Approach to Integrate AI in Enterprise Strategy

Here we offer a framework, based on First Principles, how to ensure we explore all the critical areas for a business and extract the most valuable AI initiatives. One of the challenges with AI is that it can be applied to most areas in a business; therefore prioritization is crucial.Table 11-2&#x20;

This systematic framework expanded in Table [11-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2), encourages a methodical and iterative approach to exploring AI benefits in business alternatives. By continually revisiting and refining your AI strategy based on real-world results, you can maximize the business value of your AI initiatives.

The process of integration involves strategically aligning the potential AI projects discovered using the data monetization framework for AI with the organization’s business strategy. However, it is common for organizations to face the challenge of business strategy and AI strategy being carried out in isolation.

### The First Principles Framework for AI Opportunities

AI adoption in a business context is far more than just deploying sophisticated algorithms – it is about identifying the right problems, leveraging the right data, and aligning with business objectives. This is best achieved using the First Principles approach, which involves a clear and methodical process. My recommendation is to use the AI data framework (Figure [11-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)) we discussed in Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml). There are other frameworks which can also be used; however, it is very important to ensure there is a bi-directional feedback loop between uncovering AI opportunities and the overall enterprise business strategy.

### Integration of Business Strategy with AI Strategy

Once all the potential AI projects have been identified, it is critical to align all those with the overall business strategy. When it comes to integrating AI into your business strategy, it is important to start from First Principles. This approach facilitates a deep understanding of the intersection between business strategy and AI strategy, promoting informed decision-making and fostering innovative solutions.

Firstly, let’s identify the most popular business strategy frameworks:

* **SWOT Analysis**: A method of identifying Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats in your business environment.
* **Porter’s Five Forces**: A model that analyzes the competitive environment in terms of five key forces: supplier power, buyer power, competitive rivalry, the threat of substitution, and the threat of new entry.
* **Blue Ocean Strategy**: This approach encourages businesses to create new demand in an uncontested market space rather than compete in overcrowded industries.
* **Value Chain Analysis**: A process where you identify the primary and support activities that create value in your business.
* **Balanced Scorecard**: **This framework helps you measure performance from multiple perspectives**, including learning and growth, business processes, customers, and financials.

Given these frameworks, integrating potential AI projects identified through the data monetization framework involves aligning them with your overarching business objectives.

Consider the following example: Suppose you have identified a potential AI project that utilizes machine learning to improve supply chain logistics, reducing inefficiencies and cost.

* If your business strategy (using the Porter’s Five Forces model) identifies high supplier power as a threat to profitability, this AI project could be a valuable strategic initiative. The project aligns with the business strategy by directly addressing a key competitive force.
* Conversely, if the strategy prioritizes expanding into new markets (aligned with Blue Ocean Strategy), the AI project might be less relevant and could be deprioritized.

Creating a matrix can help align AI projects with business strategy frameworks (Table [11-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3)). For instance, you could list potential AI projects along one axis and strategic goals along the other. This allows you to easily visualize how each AI project aligns with the business strategy and assists in prioritizing projects based on their strategic relevance and potential impact.Table 11-3&#x20;

Business areas mapped to business strategy frameworks

| AI project                 | SWOT | Porter’s Five Forces | Blue Ocean Strategy | Value Chain Analysis | Balanced Scorecard |
| -------------------------- | ---- | -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Supply chain optimization  | ✓    | ✓                    |                     | ✓                    | ✓                  |
| Customer segmentation      | ✓    |                      | ✓                   | ✓                    | ✓                  |
| Predictive maintenance     | ✓    | ✓                    |                     | ✓                    |                    |
| Automated customer service |      | ✓                    | ✓                   | ✓                    | ✓                  |

One of the biggest challenges in integrating AI and business strategy is that they are often treated as separate domains. To overcome this, organizations need to encourage cross-functional collaboration and adopt an iterative, agile approach. AI projects should be continuously evaluated and adjusted considering shifting business goals and competitive landscapes.

Furthermore, fostering an AI-ready culture within the organization is essential. This means upskilling employees, promoting a data-driven mindset, and ensuring AI ethics and governance are given due importance.

Lastly, remember that AI should not be viewed as an end in itself, but as a means to achieving strategic business objectives. Effective integration of business strategy with AI strategy ensures that AI initiatives are driven by business needs and are designed to deliver measurable business outcomes.

Let’s consider another example of an e-commerce company named “E-Shopify.” Their main business strategy, created using the Blue Ocean Strategy, is to differentiate themselves in the crowded e-commerce market by providing exceptional customer experience.

During the process of using the data monetization framework for AI, several AI initiatives were discovered such as personalized product recommendations, automated customer service bots, real-time inventory management, and predictive analysis of consumer buying behavior.

The next step involves integrating these AI projects into their business strategy (see Table [11-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab4)). For instance, personalized product recommendations and automated customer service bots could directly align with their business strategy of enhancing customer experience, making them a high priority. Real-time inventory management, while useful, might not directly influence the customer experience.Table 11-4&#x20;

AI initiatives aligned with E-Shopify’s strategy

| AI initiative                          | Alignment with business strategy | Priority |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Personalized product recommendations   | High                             | High     |
| Automated customer service bots        | High                             | High     |
| Real-time inventory management         | Medium                           | Medium   |
| Predictive analysis of buying behavior | Low                              | Low      |

It is critical to note that aligning AI initiatives with the business strategy should not be a one-time exercise. Business strategies often need to adapt to market dynamics, and so should AI projects.

To ensure the continuous integration of business strategy and AI strategy, companies need to foster a culture of communication and collaboration across all departments. AI strategy should not be the responsibility of just the IT or data science department. Instead, it should involve stakeholders from various departments who understand the business’ strategic goals.

As we have seen, it is clear that while the business strategy should steer the direction of AI initiatives, there is also a feedback mechanism, where AI capabilities might uncover value not seen with the traditional strategy approached (please refer to Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml) and the AI Data Flywheel). By identifying potential AI projects, aligning them with business strategy, and creating a collaborative, adaptable strategy environment, companies can ensure that their AI initiatives provide the maximum value and help them stand out in the competitive business world.

### Integrating AI Strategy with Data Governance and Management

AI solutions often rely heavily on data, making data governance and management a crucial part of any AI strategy. This section delves into how to ensure data quality and availability, enable data collaboration and sharing, and scale AI throughout the enterprise.

> _Definition of data quality: Mentioned in multiple chapters, it is a multi-faceted concept, essentially refers to the various parameters such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, representativeness, and timeliness, which determine the fitness of data for a specific use or task._

There are three main steps (Table [11-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5)):

* **Step 1: Ensuring data** **quality and availability**. Data is the fuel for AI. Ensuring that the data is of high quality and is readily available for AI applications is crucial. Data quality includes accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and consistency. Techniques such as data validation, cleaning, transformation, and integration can help improve data quality.
* **Step 2: Enabling data** **collaboration and sharing**. In an increasingly interconnected world, enabling collaboration and sharing of data across different departments, and even different organizations, can unlock new AI opportunities. It is essential to have robust data governance policies and data sharing agreements to ensure data privacy and security.
* **Step 3:** **Scaling** **AI on the enterprise**. The ultimate goal is to scale AI applications across the enterprise for maximum impact. This involves not just the technological aspects such as cloud computing but also cultural aspects like fostering an AI-first mentality among employees.
