# 12. Funding and Measuring the AI Journey

When embarking on an AI journey, the interconnection between funding, implementing AI initiatives, and measuring their impact is vital. This chapter will help you understand these components and how to apply a First Principles approach to each one. This chapter we will explore a guide to AI ROI, cost management, and impact analysis.

AI has the potential to revolutionize business models and processes, but to do so, significant resources are required. Securing funds for AI initiatives is the first major step in this journey. Once funding is secured, businesses can initiate the development and implementation of AI projects. After implementing the AI project, measuring its impact becomes essential to evaluate its effectiveness and ROI.

These elements are interconnected and influence one another (Table [12-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)). For example, the potential impact of an AI initiative can play a significant role in securing funding. Simultaneously, the results derived from evaluating AI projects can help guide future funding decisions, including scaling existing projects or investing in new ones.

The First Principles approach is crucial in this context. In securing funds, it helps you identifying the core reasons why an AI initiative is necessary and how it can strategically align with your business objectives.

In evaluating AI initiatives, the First Principles _**approach ensures the development of an effective and relevant metrics system that genuinely reflects the initiative’s impact**_. This thought process avoids relying on preconceived notions or industry norms, enabling a more accurate evaluation that can contribute to strategic decision-making.Table 12-1&#x20;

### Funding the AI Journey

Funding is the lifeblood of any AI initiative, and securing it requires careful planning and strategy. In this section, we will delve into different funding options, how to navigate cost constraints (Table [12-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)), and strategies for budgeting and cost management using a First Principles approach.Table 12-2&#x20;

Navigating cost constraint scenarios with a First Principles approach

| Cost constraint scenario | First Principles approach                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Limited budget           | Consider a phased approach, starting with smaller, less costly AI projects that can provide quick wins    |
| Limited AI expertise     | Look for partnerships with universities or consider upskilling current employees                          |
| High data costs          | Leverage open-source data, negotiate partnerships for data sharing, or invest in generating your own data |

#### Internal Funding Options

This is the typical option in most scenarios within the enterprise. Internal funding comes from within your organization and may include reinvestment of profits, operating budgets, or internal fundraising efforts. The primary advantage of internal funding is the control it provides over the initiative. Other benefits include greater flexibility and reduced risks, by not depending on third parties.

Using First Principles thinking, consider how your AI initiatives align with your organization’s strategic objectives, what value they bring, and how they can be prioritized within your budget constraints.

For instance, if your AI project aims to automate a costly process, resulting in substantial cost savings, it might justify allocation of a significant part of the operational budget.

There are a few options to allocate the internal funding:

* **Allocating existing resources**: Businesses can use their own resources to fund AI implementations. This may include using existing budgets, reallocating resources, or investing in new technologies.
* **Capital investment**: Businesses can also invest in AI by using capital from company profits or by setting aside a strategic AI investment budget.
* **Employee training and upskilling**: Businesses can invest in AI by training and upskilling their employees in AI-related skills. This can be done through in-house training programs or by partnering with external organizations.

There are also a few challenges with internal funding:

* Many organizations do **incremental budgeting**, which means each department is allocated a size of the budget proportionate to last year’s cost. This means that new areas or cross-areas projects (like AI and data projects often are) are difficult to get assigned to the right cost center. Organizations with zero-budget process do not have this challenge, but these are not very common.
* **Less expertise**: Businesses may not have the in-house expertise to implement AI effectively. This may require them to hire external consultants or partners, which can add to the cost of implementation.

#### External Funding Options

External funding sources may include government grants and incentives, venture capital and private equity, corporate partnerships and collaborations, crowdfunding and alternative financing methods. Each of these options requires a compelling business case and a clear demonstration of potential return on investment.

When applying First Principles thinking to external funding, it’s essential to question how your AI initiative will create value that external stakeholders can appreciate, and how that aligns with their investment or funding criteria.

For example, a venture capital firm might be interested in an AI project that could scale quickly and provide a high return on investment, while a government grant might require the initiative to have societal benefits.

**Government grants** and incentives offer substantial financial support but come with stringent eligibility criteria and a complex application process. Despite being time-consuming, their potential for significant funding cannot be overlooked.

**Venture capital (VC)** and **private equity (PE)** firms provide both funding and expertise. However, in exchange, these firms typically require an equity stake in your business. Successful pitching, understanding the investor’s interest, and negotiating investment terms and conditions are key in securing VC and PE funds. As a reference, VC firms typically invest in companies that have the potential for high growth, while PE firms typically invest in companies that are already profitable. Should an investor be interested in your project, they will typically ask you to sign a _**term sheet**_. A term sheet is a document that outlines the key terms of an investment agreement. It includes information such as the amount of investment, the valuation of the company, and the terms of repayment.

**Corporate partnerships** provide financial support and potentially access to resources, market opportunities, and expertise. Identifying companies with an interest in AI and negotiating mutually beneficial terms are critical steps in this process.

**Crowdfunding** offers more flexibility and entails raising funds from many individuals or organizations, typically through online platforms. Successful crowdfunding requires compelling storytelling, realistic funding goals, and strategic marketing to engage potential backers.

Each funding option comes with its unique set of advantages, potential drawbacks, and requirements, making it crucial to carefully assess and select the most suitable funding source based on specific needs and circumstances.

#### Navigating Cost Constraint Scenarios

Cost constraints are a reality of any business initiative. However, by using First Principles reasoning, we can think creatively about how to get the most out of our available resources. Businesses may face two primary cost constraint scenarios when implementing AI solutions: bootstrapping an AI project and prioritizing AI features and functionalities.

Different scenarios will call for different strategies. A First Principles approach here is about designing the optimal plan given your specific conditions, rather than following a one-size-fits-all strategy.

In **bootstrapping** an AI project, businesses with limited funding can minimize initial costs and gradually scale up AI implementation by leveraging existing resources, such as open-source software and in-house data. Using platforms like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn can help avoid high licensing costs while reusing existing data negates the need for acquiring new datasets. An incremental development approach, starting with a minimum viable product (MVP), helps minimize risks and costs associated with large-scale AI projects.

For instance, in a scenario with severe cost constraints, a **phased approach** might be preferable, starting with smaller AI initiatives that deliver quick wins and generate savings, which can then be reinvested into larger projects. Alternatively, when budget constraints are present, businesses must prioritize the AI features and functionalities that will have the most significant impact on their operations. This prioritization involves identifying key areas where AI can add value and implementing a phased approach to AI development and deployment. These key areas might include customer service, supply chain management, or product recommendations. The phased approach allows for efficient resource allocation, risk minimization, and generation of quick wins that justify further AI investment.

In another example, if budget constraints limit hiring of AI specialists, consider partnering with universities for research collaborations, or investing in upskilling existing employees.

Businesses can successfully navigate cost constraints by bootstrapping their projects and prioritizing impactful AI features or looking for AI resources in alternative sources. Regularly revisiting budget allocations, reassessing priorities, and refining AI models based on performance and feedback are crucial for the ongoing success of AI initiatives. The key to successful AI implementation lies in balancing funding, cost management, and strategic prioritization to unlock the full potential of AI and drive business growth and innovation.

#### Budgeting and Cost Management

Budgeting and cost management are crucial for ensuring the financial sustainability of your AI initiatives. Implementing AI solutions requires careful budgeting and cost management, which includes estimating AI project costs, financial planning and forecasting, and cost monitoring and control. A First Principles approach to this involves going beyond traditional budgeting methods and considering the unique aspects of AI projects.

These could include costs associated with data acquisition and cleansing, development and maintenance of AI models, infrastructure, and potentially, the upskilling of employees.

Estimating AI project costs involves accounting for hardware and software expenses, human resources and talent acquisition costs, as well as maintenance and ongoing support. Specialized hardware like GPUs for training AI models, software tools for data storage and processing, hiring specialized roles like data scientists and machine learning engineers, and maintaining AI models and infrastructure are significant cost considerations.

Financial planning and forecasting require setting realistic budgets based on the project’s complexity, expected duration, and potential ROI. It is important to avoid underestimating costs to prevent project delays or failure. Also, contingency planning is crucial for covering unexpected costs such as hardware or software failure, or changes in project scope.

Cost monitoring and control involve tracking expenses throughout the project’s lifecycle to ensure staying within budget and identifying potential cost overruns early. Identifying cost overruns and implementing mitigation strategies, including revising project scope, eliminating inefficiencies, renegotiating contracts, or exploring alternative hardware or software solutions, can help control expenses.

It is also very important for AI projects to look after the post-implementation, cost monitoring and control become vital to ensure that the project stays within budget. This process involves tracking all expenses, identifying cost overruns, and implementing cost-saving measures if necessary, such as reducing project scope or seeking less expensive alternatives for hardware and software.

Effective budgeting and cost management are vital for successful AI implementation. Accurate cost estimation, realistic budgeting, expense monitoring, and contingency planning can maximize ROI and ensure long-term project success. It enables businesses to make informed decisions about their AI investments and positions them to capitalize on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence.

### Establishing a Framework for Measuring AI Impact and ROI

Measuring the impact of AI is fundamental to demonstrating the value of your initiatives and understand where to focus future investments. In this section, we will explore the establishment of a comprehensive framework for gauging AI’s impact and ROI, using a First Principles approach.

The first key aspect in determining the return on investment (ROI) and success metrics in AI projects is to define a clear success criteria:

* **Quantitative metrics** are crucial for objective evaluations of the project’s performance. This includes model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, etc.), business outcome metrics (revenue growth, cost reduction, etc.), and operational efficiency metrics (model training time, data processing speed, etc.).
* **Qualitative benefits** are also important and include improved decision-making, enhanced customer experiences, increased innovation, and competitive advantage derived from AI implementation.

Here, many AI projects will replace an existing product or process. In these cases, it is _**also very important to ensure you capture the existing baseline, so it can be compared with the new technology**_. I have seen many projects failed on managing expectations; baseline metrics are not captured prior the new project, and when the new project does not reach the very often unrealistic expectations, the project can be “perceived” to be a failure, even if the AI performs much better than the old process.

The second aspect is to ensure there is a transparent and agreed by all stakeholder approach at measuring ROI:

* **Direct financial returns** are calculated by comparing the returns generated by the project with the total investment. This considers factors like increased revenue, cost reduction, and improved operational efficiency.
* **Indirect benefits and cost savings** should also be considered, such as increased customer satisfaction, reduced employee turnover, and enhanced brand reputation, all potentially stemming from AI implementation. For instance, an AI-powered customer service chatbot could lead to decreased customer support costs and improved customer loyalty.

#### Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with First Principles

KPIs act as a compass, pointing your AI initiatives in the right direction and providing a quantifiable measure of their success. Instead of blindly following common KPIs like accuracy or cost savings, a First Principles approach invites us to dissect the core purpose of our AI initiatives and establish KPIs that directly measure these fundamental objectives.

For example, an AI initiative aimed at improving customer service could establish a KPI around customer satisfaction scores, not just the number of inquiries handled. Table [12-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3) shows popular AI KPIs.Table 12-3&#x20;

Common AI KPI

| Metric type            | Examples                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model performance      | Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC                                         |
| Business outcomes      | Revenue growth, cost reduction, customer satisfaction, employee productivity |
| Operational efficiency | Model training time, data processing speed, infrastructure costs             |

When planning to leverage AI to grow your business, it is critical to set measurable goals. This is where Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) come in. KPIs allow you to gauge the success of your AI projects and assess whether they’re helping you meet your business objectives. Here, we will discuss the most common KPIs related to model performance, business outcomes, and operational efficiency, and how to communicate them effectively through storytelling.

Model performance KPIs evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of your AI models. Some common KPIs include

* **Precision**: This measures the percentage of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.
* **Recall (sensitivity)**: This measures the percentage of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
* **F1 score**: This is the harmonic mean[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1) of precision and recall, providing a balance between these two measures.
* **Area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC)**: This measures the model’s ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes, with 1 representing a perfect model and 0.5 indicating a model performing no better than random guessing.

As well as the technical performance metrics, it is extremely important to translate the model impact in business outcome KPIs, so we can track the impact of AI projects on your key business metrics. These can include

* **Revenue growth**: This measures the increase in revenue attributable to the AI project.
* **Cost reduction**: This measures the decrease in costs due to the AI project.
* **Customer satisfaction**: This can be measured using surveys, customer reviews, or net promoter scores, assessing whether the AI project improves customer experiences.
* **Employee productivity**: This measures improvements in output or task completion speed as a result of the AI project.

Finally, operational efficiency KPIs assess how effectively and efficiently your AI project operates. Examples include

* **Model training time**: It measures how long it takes to train your AI models. This will also be related to the training cost, and for large models – such as large language models – where the cost can be millions of dollars, it is something to keep focus to minimize as much as possible.
* **Data processing speed**: This measures the speed at which your AI system can process data. Sometimes called “inference time.”
* **Infrastructure costs**: This measures the cost of maintaining the hardware and software needed for your AI project.

#### Assessing AI Maturity Levels

The maturity level of your AI initiatives refers to the sophistication of your AI deployment, measured across dimensions such as data infrastructure, AI skills, and the level of AI integration into business processes.

Using First Principles thinking, we should evaluate our maturity level based not only on our current capabilities but also our strategic objectives. This would allow us to identify areas of focus to move from our current to desired state.

We will discuss in further detail the different AI maturity levels in Chapter [21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml).

#### Aligning AI KPIs with Business Objectives

To ensure that AI initiatives drive real business value, their KPIs should be tightly aligned with your overarching business objectives. A First Principles approach involves breaking down these high-level objectives into actionable, measurable components that AI can impact.

For example, if the business objective is to increase market share, an associated AI KPI could be the accuracy of an AI-powered market prediction tool. Table [12-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab4) displays a sample AI maturity roadmap action plan.Table 12-4&#x20;

Assessing AI maturity levels with a First Principles approach

| AI maturity dimension | Current state        | Desired state                            | Actionable steps                                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data infrastructure   | Basic data storage   | Advanced cloud-based data infrastructure | Invest in cloud storage, improve data collection and cleaning processes    |
| AI skills             | Limited AI knowledge | Skilled AI team                          | Upskill existing staff, hire new AI talent                                 |
| AI integration        | Ad hoc AI projects   | AI integrated into all business units    | Develop a company-wide AI strategy, encourage cross-functional AI projects |

### Tracking and Demonstrating ROI for AI Initiatives

Building AI capabilities is just half the battle; the other half is effectively tracking their performance and communicating the return on investment (ROI). In this section, we will explore how to measure, evaluate, and present the ROI of your AI initiatives effectively. Here, I cannot stress how important this is, specially for larger organizations, as in many businesses “perception is reality” – therefore, if you do not communicate the value of your AI projects in the language of the rest of the executive team, they would assume (incorrectly) that your AI projects do not have any value for the organization.

The first step in demonstrating ROI is _**establishing a tracking system for your AI Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).**_ A First Principles approach here involves understanding what data is essential for measuring your KPIs and setting up a systematic process for data collection, processing, and analysis. For example, a customer service AI might require tracking of response times, customer satisfaction scores, and issue resolution rates.

Calculating the ROI of AI projects involves comparing the cost of the project to the value it delivers. Value can come in various forms, from cost savings and revenue generation to fewer tangible benefits like improved customer satisfaction or decision-making speed.

Here, First Principles thinking can help identify the fundamental sources of value that your AI initiatives deliver, translating them into monetary terms where possible.

Clearly _**communicating the impact and ROI of AI initiatives**_ is crucial to secure continued investment and support. A First Principles approach can help frame communication around the fundamental objectives the AI initiatives are achieving. Data visualization can be highly effective in this process, making it easy to understand complex data at a glance.

Just as AI learns and adapts, so should your strategy. By continually measuring and analyzing the performance of your AI initiatives, you can identify areas of improvement and adapt your strategy accordingly. A First Principles mindset will ensure you’re focusing on the core objectives, not just surface-level metrics. The following Table [12-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5) has an example of ROI for an AI initiative.Table 12-5&#x20;

Example of an AI project ROI calculation

| AI project          | Project cost | Value delivered                                                | ROI |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Customer service AI | $50,000      | $75,000 (saved in labor cost + improved customer satisfaction) | 50% |

### Storytelling and Communication

While the KPIs offer crucial insights, raw data can often be dry and challenging to interpret for non-technical stakeholders. Therefore, to maximize the impact of your AI project, you need to communicate these metrics effectively, and storytelling can be a powerful tool for this.

Storytelling involves presenting your data and KPIs in the form of a narrative that emphasizes business outcomes, making it more relatable and easier to understand for your audience. It allows us to communicate the insights and implications of a data science project in an engaging and accessible manner. To illustrate, let’s consider a specific example: using an AI model to understand customer behavior in a retail business.

Let’s say we are a large retail company looking to optimize our operations by determining the potential of online sales versus physical stores. We have collected data on customer preferences and shopping habits and used this to train a machine learning model. The model takes into account various factors such as age, income, location, and past purchase behavior to predict whether a customer is likely to shop online or in a physical store.

Our AI model’s effectiveness is measured using different metrics, two of the most common being the confusion matrix and the AUC-ROC curve.

The confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. In our case, it allows us to visualize the performance of our model in predicting whether a customer prefers shopping online or in-store.

In Table [12-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab6), this hypothetical confusion matrix, TP, FP, FN, and TN, represents True Positives, False Positives, False Negatives, and True Negatives, respectively. Our model correctly predicted 1000 in-store customers and 1500 online customers. It made a mistake with 200 in-store and 300 online customers.Table 12-6&#x20;

Confusion matrix

|                  | Predicted: in-store Predicted: online | Predicted: in-store Predicted: online |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Actual: in-store | 1000 (TP)                             | 200 (FP)                              |
| Actual: online   | 300 (FN)                              | 1500 (TN)                             |

Another important metric is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), as seen in Figure [12-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1). This measures the trade-off between correctly predicting a positive class (True Positive Rate) and wrongly predicting a negative class (False Positive Rate). In our case, our model’s AUC is 78%, which is considered good.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_12_Chapter/605840_1_En_12_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="790" width="885"><figcaption><p>Figure 12-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

Translating these results into a business context, let’s assume our total customer base is 3000 customers. Our model predicts that approximately 68% of our customers prefer online shopping.

To make this more relatable, we can visualize this information in a pie chart presented in Figure [12-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_12_Chapter/605840_1_En_12_Fig2_HTML.png" alt="" height="859" width="1317"><figcaption><p>Figure 12-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

Now, what does this all mean in terms of actionable insights? If 68% of our customers prefer shopping online, and assuming the trend is going to continue or even increase, then the potential for cost savings by reducing the number of physical stores is substantial. We could consider closing underperforming stores or even most of our physical stores while maintaining one flagship store for customers who still prefer the in-store experience. We should also recommend re-enforcing the ecommerce website to take more customers, as users swap their physical store visits for the convenience of online shopping.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_12_Chapter/605840_1_En_12_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="696" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 12-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

We can see in Figure [12-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) three different ways to communicate the output of an AI model. The three diagrams show the same results; however most people would agree that the suggested actions diagram is the most clear of the three from a business outcomes perspective. Unfortunately, many data science teams focus mainly on reporting on the technical model performance. This will not communicate effectively to their business colleagues the implications of their model and the default model for the business executives would be to assume the model is not practical.

This is just an example, but it shows how data science can be used to inform business decisions. The key to effective data storytelling is to present your findings in a way that is _**understandable, meaningful, and actionable**_ for your audience. Remember, your goal is not just to show what the data says, but to tell a story about how this data can be used to drive strategic business decisions. And finally, do not forget that effective storytelling should not just expose facts but also suggest actions.
