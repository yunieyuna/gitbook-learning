### AI Hardware and Infrastructure

Hardware has been no doubt one of the fundamental core component drivers in advancing AI. Comparing hardware capability to when AI started back in the 1950s to hardware 2020s is extremely more powerful and cheaper. As popular science author Michio Kaku[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn7) put it:

> _Today, your cell phone has more computer power than all of NASA back in 1969, when it placed two astronauts on the moon._

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_6_Chapter/605840_1_En_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1038" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

Behind this incredible progress, we have Moore’s Law[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn8), first proposed by Gordon Moore in 1965 (Figure [6-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). It is an empirical observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every 2 years, leading to a corresponding increase in processing power. This trend has been a driving force behind the rapid advancements in computing and technology over the past several decades. However, as we approach the physical limits of silicon-based chip manufacturing, Moore’s Law is expected to slow down. Researchers and engineers are exploring alternative materials and innovative chip architectures, such as 3D stacking and neuromorphic computing, to continue the progress. Although it is unclear how much further Moore’s Law can be sustained, ongoing innovations in the field suggest that the growth of computing power will continue, albeit at a potentially slower pace.

Another important point to consider about the future evolution of computers, looking at First Principles, is the efficiency of current computers and how they compare to biological brains.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_6_Chapter/605840_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="979" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

Figure [6-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn9) shows that current computer architecture requires quite a bit of power per computing unit, and when compared to biological brains, there is a large gap in efficiency. Indeed, the human brain is an impressive biological machine, capable of storing vast amounts of information and processing it at incredible speeds. It does this while maintaining a relatively small size and consuming minimal power. In comparison, modern supercomputers, though powerful, still fall short in terms of size and power consumption efficiency. The race for the world’s fastest and most power-efficient supercomputer is on, but the industry is facing new bottlenecks as transistor density reaches its limit on 2D chips.

One of the areas that the computer industry is exploring to improve its efficiency is to turn to the human brain for inspiration. The brain’s efficiency is unmatched, _**achieving five to six orders of magnitude more computing per unit of energy consumed**_. This incredible efficiency is achieved while simultaneously supporting the brain’s cellular activities.

It is also important to point out that as well as generic computing components, there have also been notable advancements in specialized AI hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which have significantly accelerated the development and deployment of AI systems. GPUs, originally designed for rendering graphics, have proven to be highly efficient in handling the parallel computations required for deep learning. Their parallel processing capabilities have made them the go-to choice for training large neural networks.

On the other hand, TPUs, developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks, offer a more tailored solution for AI workloads. TPUs are designed to accelerate tensor operations, the core computations used in deep learning algorithms. They offer greater performance per watt compared to GPUs, making them more energy-efficient for AI processing.

Together, these specialized AI hardware components have dramatically reduced the time and cost associated with training and deploying AI models, enabling businesses to leverage AI-driven solutions more efficiently.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_6_Chapter/605840_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.png" alt="" height="1222" width="1712"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

Figure [6-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5) shows the growth on computing power, with the latest known AI system (GPT4) needed more than 10 billion PetaFLOPs.

In terms of infrastructure, the advent of cloud-based AI platforms and infrastructure has democratized access to AI capabilities and resources. Cloud providers, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, offer comprehensive AI services and tools that cater to various AI workloads, from training and inference to deployment and management. Businesses can leverage these platforms to scale AI applications without the need for significant upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure.

Furthermore, cloud-based AI platforms offer seamless integration with other cloud services, such as data storage and analytics, facilitating a more cohesive and efficient AI development pipeline. This enables businesses to focus on their core competencies and innovate faster with AI-driven solutions. We will go into all these details later in the HOW part of the book.

Another interesting trend is edge computing and on-device AI. Both have emerged as key trends in AI hardware and infrastructure, driven by the need for real-time processing, reduced latency, and improved privacy. By bringing AI processing closer to the data source, edge computing enables faster decision-making and minimizes the need to transmit data to centralized data centers, thereby reducing bandwidth requirements and associated costs.

On-device AI, powered by specialized chips like Apple’s Neural Engine and Google’s Edge TPU, allows for local AI processing on smartphones, IoT devices, and other edge devices. This facilitates real-time, context-aware AI applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart home systems, and wearable health monitors.

As a final trend, Quantum Computing, an emerging field of study that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, holds immense potential for revolutionizing AI hardware and infrastructure. Quantum computers are designed to solve certain types of complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, making them an ideal candidate for solving some optimization problems and accelerating AI model training. We will also go into detail at the end of the book.

Although quantum computing is still in its early stages of development, its potential impact on AI is substantial. Companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are actively researching and developing quantum computing technologies, which, if successful, could drastically change the AI landscape, enabling more efficient and powerful AI systems.
