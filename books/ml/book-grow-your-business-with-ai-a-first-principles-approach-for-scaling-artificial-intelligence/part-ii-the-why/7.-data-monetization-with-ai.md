# 7. Data Monetization with AI

In today’s digital era, businesses accumulate vast quantities of data, the **“new oil”** of the economy. This data is a goldmine for generating business growth and revenue. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for data monetization – converting data into actionable insights or products that create business value – is our primary focus. This chapter equips business executives with essential knowledge on data monetization, enabling the effective utilization of data assets.

Firstly, we demystify data monetization, illustrating various ways to achieve it. Common misconceptions abound, such as only large corporations can monetize data or data monetization exclusively involves selling data. These notions are fallacies. Any business, regardless of size or industry, can reap benefits from data monetization through numerous direct and indirect approaches.

To assist organizations in making educated decisions and prioritizing data assets, we delve into identifying monetizable data, emphasizing the critical role of data governance and compliance.

A step-by-step framework is presented to offer a transparent roadmap for businesses, employing AI to distill insights from data, thereby creating new revenue channels and amplifying business value. This roadmap navigates different business models, data marketplaces, and platforms, allowing organizations to understand opportunities and potential pitfalls in data monetization.

The benefits of data monetization are manifold. Companies that effectively leverage AI to monetize data can achieve competitive advantage, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost profitability. Further, it enables more informed decision-making, uncovers new business prospects, and instills a data-driven culture, promoting continuous innovation and learning.

The chapter concludes by addressing the challenges and limitations of data monetization, providing strategies to minimize risks and optimize returns.

Readers will gain a robust understanding of data monetization through AI by the end of this chapter, paving the way for informed decisions and effective utilization of data assets. The subsequent chapters will provide in-depth guidance on how to implement these concepts, enabling businesses to confidently embark on their data monetization journey toward a successful AI-driven future.

### Defining Data Monetization

Understanding data monetization begins with a firm grasp of data fundamentals. Businesses amass data through transactions, customer interactions, operations, and external sources like suppliers. This data, a significant resource, can be processed and analyzed to provide valuable insights, enhance operations, and fuel growth.

> _Definition of Data used throughout the book._

> _Data in the business context refers to quantifiable, observable, and recordable information that is collected, stored, and used for the purpose of analysis or decision-making. It can come in many forms, such as numbers, words, images, videos, phone calls, and even customer behaviors._

In AI systems, data serves as the starting point and training material. Greater data volume generally equates to better performing AI systems. Often, these systems process large volumes of alternative or unstructured data such as satellite images, biometrics, or telematics.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="967" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

It is useful to classify data into three main types (see Figure [7-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)):

* **Structured data**: Organized in a standard format like tables or spreadsheets, making it easily processable using traditional data tools.
* **Semi-structured data**: Not arranged in a regular format but still holds some structure. More challenging to process than structured data, it can still be managed using traditional tools.
* **Unstructured data**: Lacks any regular format, making it difficult to process and analyze, yet valuable for AI applications.

Alternative data, not conventionally used for traditional processing applications, includes sources like social media data, sensor data, and satellite imagery. It holds high value for AI applications as it can offer unique insights.

Tip&#x20;

Sometimes, the data you have on hand might not be the most suitable for the problem you are trying to solve. In such cases, it’s important to take a step back and reconsider the “job to be done” with your data (more on this later). What specific objective are you trying to achieve? Which insights are you looking for? Depending on the answers, you might need to adjust the way you collect or handle your data.

AI systems are sensitive to data accuracy, as even minor errors can lead to inaccurate predictions. The value of data is determined by its ability to generate revenue, improve efficiency, and cut costs. Additionally, data quality, timeliness, and relevance also impact its value.

Companies often mistake data to be a static IT asset. Those placing high value on data tend to develop data-driven business models, leading to improved decision-making and increased profits. Such models generally result in long-term success. Data ownership and accountability structures across the organization play a vital role in the overall data governance structure.

**Data governance** ensures data management aligns with business needs, encompassing activities like data classification, data ownership, data security, and data quality assurance. Its importance varies across companies and industries, and it serves to

* Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* Ensure data usage aligns with business needs.
* Comply with laws and regulations.

Copying successful companies from other industries without consideration for specific governance needs often leads to problems. While data governance can be complex and challenging, it’s crucial for effective data management. More details on this topic will be discussed in later chapters.

#### Myths About Data Monetization

In the business realm, data is a valuable asset, often clouded by misconceptions that constrain its full potential. Here’s a brief overview of typical data-related myths and their corresponding facts:

* **Myth: “Data monetization means selling data.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. Monetizing data does not necessarily mean selling data. This can include selling data, but it can also involve using data to improve internal processes, enhance customer experiences, or develop new products and services.
* **Myth: “Data monetization is only for large enterprises.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. Businesses of all sizes can benefit from data monetization. While large enterprises may have more data and resources at their disposal, small- and medium-sized businesses can also leverage their data assets to create value and drive growth.
* **Myth: “Data privacy regulations make data monetization impossible.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. While data privacy regulations like Europe’s GDPR[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1) and California’s CCPA[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) impose certain restrictions on data usage and sharing, they do not prohibit data monetization entirely. Businesses must comply with these regulations by obtaining proper consent, anonymizing data, and implementing strong security measures. So, they can monetize their data and respect user privacy and laws.
* **Myth: “Data monetization requires complex technology and expertise.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. There are many tools and services available that can simplify the process for businesses. Companies can start with basic analytics and gradually move toward more advanced techniques as they become more data driven.
* **Myth: “All data is equally valuable for monetization.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. The value of data depends on its relevance, quality, and potential for generating insights. Data that is outdated, inaccurate, or lacking context may have limited value for monetization. Businesses should focus on collecting and maintaining high-quality data that can drive meaningful insights and actions.
* **Myth: “More data means higher accuracy.”**
  * Reality: Incorrect. This is a myth that every business looking for data science consulting should get rid of right away. The quality of the data is more important than the quantity.

### Data as a Financial Asset?

The concept of Infonomics, introduced in Gartner’s book of the same name (Figure [7-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)), advocates treating data as a financial asset. This innovative approach, highlighting data’s economic significance, inspires businesses to manage data with the strategic focus traditionally accorded to assets like real estate and intellectual property. I was a Gartner’s client many years, so I had the opportunity to meet the author, Douglas B. Laney.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="885" width="590"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

Infonomics perceives data as holding intrinsic financial value. When harnessed effectively, this value can deliver tangible business benefits, such as better decision-making, enhanced operational efficiency, and the creation of new products and services. The discipline aims to assign a quantifiable value to data, enabling its management like any conventional asset.

However, despite the promising potential of Infonomics, it has not yet gained widespread acceptance in the industry. There are several reasons for this reluctance. Firstly, the process of valuing data is complex and subjective, making it challenging for organizations to arrive at a universally accepted methodology. Secondly, data’s value may not be immediately apparent, and its worth can fluctuate depending on factors such as relevance, timeliness, and accuracy. Lastly, the lack of standardized frameworks and regulations concerning data ownership, privacy, and security poses significant obstacles to the adoption of Infonomics.

Personally, I do think it is a good idea, and it can bring value to treat data as a financial asset – same as you would do to real estate or hardware servers. However, there is a bit of a catch-22 situation: until the wider accounting community is comfortable and agreed on how to value data financially in a universal agreed way, it might not be worth the effort, and unless a lot of companies want to do it, the financial community will not go through the process of standardization. I do recommend reading the book and the concept and adopting as much as possible within practical limitations.

### Methods of Data Monetization

Data monetization, the act of deriving revenue and value from data assets, offers various methods aided by AI and data analytics advancements. These include direct and indirect monetization, AI-based product and service monetization, and data sharing through partnerships:

1.  1.**Direct monetization**: This approach is typically when the data is valuable to external parties, such as customers, partners, or other businesses.

    1.  a.

        **Selling data**: Businesses can sell their data to third parties. A telecom company, for instance, might sell anonymized location data to retailers for analyzing customer foot traffic to optimize store locations.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Licensing**: Organizations provide data usage rights for specific purposes in return for fees, offering more control over data usage. A weather data provider might license its data to insurance companies for risk assessment.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)**: Organizations offer data on-demand, typically through a subscription service. A financial data provider might offer DaaS to investment firms for market data and financial news.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.**Indirect monetization**: Rather than selling data directly, organizations use their data assets to improve internal processes, products, and services.

    1.  a.

        **Enhanced business intelligence**: Organizations leverage AI and advanced analytics to glean insights for strategic decision-making, improving customer experiences. A retail company might analyze customer data to develop targeted marketing campaigns.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Data-driven decision-making**: Organizations use data to make informed decisions. A logistics company might use AI to optimize delivery routes, minimizing fuel consumption.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **Process optimization**: AI automates and optimizes business processes, enhancing efficiency. A bank might use AI-powered chatbots to handle customer inquiries.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3.**Monetizing AI-based products and services**: Combining data with AI algorithms, organizations can create innovative solutions that address customer needs and solve complex problems

    1.  a.

        **Predictive analytics solutions**: Businesses can offer predictive analytics solutions. A machine learning firm might offer a predictive maintenance solution using IoT sensor data to forecast equipment failures.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Personalization services**: Organizations can use AI and customer data to offer personalization services. An e-commerce platform might use AI to provide personalized product recommendations.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **AI-enabled fraud detection**: Organizations can use AI solutions to detect fraud or assess risk. A credit card company might use AI to analyze transactions in real-time to detect unusual patterns.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
4.  4.**Data sharing and collaborative partnerships**: Pooling data resources, organizations can gain access to a larger and more diverse dataset, enabling them to derive richer insights and develop more innovative solutions.

    1.  a.

        **Data consortiums**: Organizations within an industry might form a data consortium to share data and collaborate on analytics projects, such as healthcare providers sharing anonymized patient data for improved disease diagnosis.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Data exchanges**: Platforms that facilitate data buying, selling, and sharing allow access to diverse data sources. An automotive company might use a data exchange to access sensor data from various manufacturers for accurate traffic prediction models.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **Joint ventures**: Organizations might partner to work on data-driven projects, leveraging combined data and expertise. A pharmaceutical company might collaborate with a biotech firm to develop AI-driven drug discovery models.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

There has also been an increase in the last few years of Software Data Vendors offering “Data Clean Rooms”; these allow for different organizations to share their data and join it to other datasets, all in a compliance and privacy-preserving way. A few vendors are Infosum[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4) or AWS Clean Rooms[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5).

### Framework for Unlocking Value from Data in Organizations

Developing a successful data monetization strategy requires a structured approach to unlock the hidden value in an organization’s data assets. Before we go into the details of the framework, it is worth noting the size of the prize, how AI can create virtuous circles, which can generate new untapped business value streams.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="733" width="1000"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

The concept of an AI data flywheel as depicted in Figure [7-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) was made famous by Amazon.[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn6) Basically, the AI data flywheel is a concept that explains how AI systems, data, and business value interact in a virtuous cycle. It all starts with data. As you deploy AI systems, they generate more data through their interactions. This new data, when fed back into the AI system, helps improve its algorithms, making it more accurate, efficient, and valuable over time. This is the “flywheel” effect: as the wheel spins (i.e., as the AI operates), it generates more of what keeps it spinning (data), thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle.

One of the key outcomes of this flywheel effect is that it can unlock new, untapped business streams. For instance, as your AI system improves and provides more precise insights, it can identify patterns and opportunities that were previously hidden. This could be anything from spotting a new market segment for your product, to identifying efficiency gains in your supply chain, or even creating entirely new product offerings based on unique data insights. The AI data flywheel thus offers businesses a powerful tool for continuous improvement and innovation. The more it spins, the more value it generates, providing businesses with a sustainable competitive advantage in today’s data-driven economy.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="975" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

The process of leveraging AI to effectively monetize data can be guided by a three-step data AI framework (Figure [7-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)):

1.  1\.

    **Value discovery: Understanding end business value by exploring the data**. The first step in data monetization is to understand the end business value of the data. This includes identifying the specific business problems that the data can help solve, as well as the potential revenue streams that can be generated from the data. This step requires a deep understanding of the organization’s business goals and objectives, as well as the market trends and customer needs. Here, it is also very important to **explore What Data You Already Have and the Gaps**: this includes understanding the types of data that are currently being collected, the sources of that data, and the quality of the data. Identifying any gaps in the data can help the organization prioritize which data to collect and how to collect it. Finally, in this step, a **high-level valuation** is performed to see whether a given initiative is worth pursuing any further. This is the step that is most overlooked for many reasons which we will explore later, and most companies do not fully explore all the potential value that their business operation could generate.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Proof of value**: This stage tests different initiatives using actual data, demonstrating potential value. With the AI implementation challenges discussed earlier, having a proven model with real business outcomes and data created by a balanced team sets the project on a successful scaling path. Skipping this stage, as many companies do, increases the risk of failure.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Scale your successful initiatives**: Once there is evidence in the proof of value that a given initiative could provide significant business outcomes, the organization can develop a plan to exploit the data. This includes identifying the specific AI technologies that can be used to extract value from the data, as well as the resources and teams that will be needed to execute the plan. This area also includes setting clear metrics and goals for the data monetization effort and establishing a process for measuring and reporting progress.

    &#x20;

Overall, data monetization is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of the organization’s business and the data it holds.

#### 1. Value Discovery

Data value exploration, the first stage in our framework, is pivotal in setting the foundation for effective data monetization. It involves gaining a deep understanding of the end business value that can be derived from your data. This entails identifying the specific business problems that the data can help solve, as well as unveiling potential revenue streams that can be generated from the data.

**1.1 Data-Driven “Jobs to Be Done”**

First, we need to have a deep understanding of the business value of data:

1.  A.

    **Identify business problems**: The first step in understanding the end business value of the data is to identify the specific business problems that the data can help solve. This could range from operational inefficiencies to customer engagement issues. The key is to match the data at your disposal with the problem and/or friction areas in your business that it could potentially alleviate. Here as well as direct customers, please do not forget to look at your overall supply chain, with all the different organizations you interact with.

    &#x20;
2.  B.

    **Uncover potential revenue streams**: The next step is to recognize the potential revenue streams that can be generated from the data. This could involve creating new products or services based on data insights or enhancing existing offerings for increased revenue generation.

    **Note** To facilitate the process of understanding the end business value, we can adopt the “jobs-to-be-done”[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn7) methodology. This approach allows us to focus on the “job” that a product or service is hired to do. In our context, the “job” is the problem that our data can solve or the value it can create for the business.

    &#x20;
3.  C.

    **Identifying “jobs”**: Start by pinpointing the “jobs” your business data can accomplish. This could be enhancing decision-making, improving product design, streamlining operations, or any number of tasks. The crucial point is to understand the end goal, that is, the job your data needs to do.

    &#x20;
4.  D.

    **Understanding customers’ jobs**: Another aspect of the JTBD methodology involves understanding the “jobs” your customers need to get done. Knowing what customers are trying to achieve can provide insights into how your data can help fulfill their needs, whether it’s about improving the user experience, personalizing offerings, or providing new services.

    &#x20;
5.  E.

    **Aligning data with jobs**: The final step involves aligning your data with the identified “jobs.” This entails determining how your data can be used or transformed to fulfill these jobs effectively.

    &#x20;

The data value exploration stage is all about setting the right foundation, and the JTBD methodology provides a structured approach to do just that.

**1.2 Data Assessment**

Once the potential business value of the key datasets has been identified, the next step is to perform a detailed data assessment, both internally and externally. While the value discovery stage will identify areas to develop (for instance, how to reduce customer churn with data from the website), the data assessment will go systematically through all the internal and external data sources that could help reduce this issue.

Here, we need to conduct the following steps for a data inventory and gap analysis:

1.  a.

    **Data inventory/cataloging**: Create a comprehensive catalog of all available data assets, including structured and unstructured data, as well as internal and external data sources. This catalog should include metadata, such as data source, data type, format, and update frequency.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Data quality assessment**: Assess the quality of the data in terms of accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and relevance. High-quality data will likely yield valuable insights and support effective decision-making.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Potential value estimation**: Evaluate the potential value of each data asset by considering factors such as the uniqueness of the data, its relevance to business goals, and its potential to generate revenue or improve operations. This assessment helps organizations prioritize their data monetization efforts.

    &#x20;
4.  d.

    **Gap analysis**: Identify gaps in the organization’s data assets, such as missing data or areas with limited data coverage. This analysis can help organizations determine which data sources to acquire or develop.

    &#x20;

**Survival Bias**

When looking at your company data, it is crucial to understand the concept of survivorship bias. It is a type of bias that occurs when we make conclusions based on the data we have while overlooking the data we do not have. This bias can distort our understanding and lead to inaccurate conclusions.

The concept of survivorship bias is best illustrated with a famous example from World War II.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="826" width="945"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

When military engineers were deciding where to add armor to bombers to better protect them, they analyzed the pattern of bullet holes on the returning planes. The initial thought was to reinforce the areas with the most damage (most red dots in Figure [7-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)). However, a statistician named Abraham Wald[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn9) pointed out that these damaged areas represented the places where the planes could take a hit and still return home. The parts of the planes without bullet holes, in contrast, were the areas where a hit was likely fatal. Therefore, those were the areas that should be reinforced. The planes that were shot down – the non-survivors – were not considered in the initial data, leading to the survivorship bias.

Similarly, in the context of AI and data analysis, survivorship bias can lead to skewed insights and faulty decision-making. For instance, businesses often interact with customers who choose to provide feedback, which is typically given after a negative experience. Companies might then draw conclusions based on this feedback and design their services or products accordingly. However, the customers who provide feedback are not representative of the entire customer base. Many satisfied customers might never reach out to provide their positive experiences, and some customers may not provide feedback regardless of their experience.

To mitigate survivorship bias in AI, it is essential to critically evaluate the sources of data and ensure they cover the full spectrum of experiences, rather than just the most vocal or visible. Wherever possible, businesses should seek to incorporate data from all customer interactions and experiences. Recognizing and addressing survivorship bias is key to developing AI models that deliver accurate insights.

**External Data Marketplaces and Platforms**

Data marketplaces and platforms provide organizations with opportunities to monetize their data by facilitating the buying, selling, and sharing of data assets. These platforms can help organizations access new data sources and reach potential customers for their data products or services. Key types include

1.  a.

    **General data marketplaces**: They offer a wide variety of data products and services, catering to a broad range of industries and use cases. Examples include AWS Data Exchange[10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn10) and the Snowflake Data Marketplace[11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn11).

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Industry-specific data marketplaces**: They focus on specific industries, such as finance, healthcare, or transportation, and offer data products and services tailored to the unique needs of those industries. Examples include Quandl[12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn12) for financial data and HealthVerity[13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn13) for healthcare data.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Data collaboration platforms**: These platforms enable organizations to share and collaborate on data assets securely, facilitating data-driven partnerships and joint ventures. Examples of data collaboration platforms include Data Republic[14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn14) and Infosum[15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn15).

    &#x20;

One thing to bear in mind is how any external data will be connected to our data, in a compliance and ethical way. This step should be considered early, to ensure the viability of data products.

**1.3 Valuation**

Project valuation is a crucial step in the data value exploration stage. It aids in prioritizing the right projects by understanding their potential value and complexity.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_7_Chapter/605840_1_En_7_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="758" width="1003"><figcaption><p>Figure 7-6 </p></figcaption></figure>

We propose a 2x2 matrix (Figure [7-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)) for this evaluation process. The Y-axis represents the value to the enterprise:

1.  A.

    **Small value**: Projects falling in this category may have a modest immediate impact but could potentially provide insights leading to larger benefits in the future.

    &#x20;
2.  B.

    **Large value**: These projects promise significant benefits, either in terms of cost savings, revenue increase, customer experience enhancement, or strategic advantage.

    &#x20;

The X-axis will indicate the project complexity, encompassing various aspects, including the complexity of the AI algorithms involved, compliance with legislation, privacy concerns, and potential ethical issues.

1.  A.

    **AI algorithm complexity**: The complexity of the algorithm dictates the technical difficulty of the project. Simple projects may involve descriptive analytics or basic predictive models, while complex projects could require advanced machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

    &#x20;
2.  B.

    **Compliance legislation**: Projects must adhere to relevant legislation, which can range from general data protection regulations to industry-specific laws. The complexity increases if the project involves sensitive data or if it operates in highly regulated industries.

    &#x20;
3.  C.

    **Privacy**: Privacy concerns amplify the complexity, especially if projects involve personal data. Projects need to ensure anonymization of data and respect privacy norms while still maintaining data usability.

    &#x20;
4.  D.

    **Ethical considerations**: Ethical considerations add another layer to project complexity. For example, fairness and bias in AI algorithms, transparency in decision-making processes, and potential misuse of AI systems can increase the ethical complexity of a project.

    &#x20;

By plotting projects on the 2x2 matrix, we can visualize their value to the enterprise against their complexity. This visual representation helps in decision-making regarding project selection, prioritization, and resource allocation. For instance, high-value, low-complexity projects could be low hanging fruits, while high-value, high-complexity projects might require careful planning and substantial resources but can bring transformational change. My personal advice for this type of project is to be very extremely mindful unless the organization has a high maturity in AI and data. Conversely, low-value, high-complexity projects might be put on hold or deprioritized.

The project valuation matrix is a practical tool to evaluate and prioritize AI projects during the data value exploration stage. The model will be further refined in a later phase; at this stage we just need high-level estimations.

#### 2. Proof of Value

Once you have identified potential areas of value, the next phase is proof of value. This step is all about quickly prototyping, testing, and validating your ideas.

In this phase, it’s crucial to establish a cross-functional team composed of data scientists, business analysts, IT professionals, and stakeholders. This team’s diversity ensures a blend of perspectives and skills, fostering innovative ideas and rigorous testing.

The team’s objective is to rapidly test hypotheses about the identified opportunities for data monetization, using a variety of analytical and AI techniques. Rapid, iterative experimentation is key here. You want to quickly learn what works and what doesn’t and adjust your approach accordingly. This process allows you to validate the business value and practical feasibility of your data monetization initiatives before you invest significant time and resources in the scale phase.

This step also leverages a network graph to represent the relationships between different entities and interactions.

There are two key further points to this approach. The first one is using a graph database, such as **Neo4j**[16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn16)**,** to map out the relationships between different entities in a business context. The graph will consist of nodes (which represent entities such as customers, products, or interactions) and edges (which represent relationships between those entities). The second one, using the concept of an AI Data flywheel we saw earlier, explores how the graph we have generated could generate future value.

It is important to emphasize that during the discovery phase, it is critical to carry out a mini-project with the right teams, tech, and infrastructure (as per later chapters). For instance, in terms of data collection, at this stage the idea is to gather enough data to provide evidence of the business and technical viability, rather than doing the full project – with the production-ready integrations. Therefore, teams using sandboxes, or the appropriate temporal data environment, are best suited to be successful. Here, I would warn against doing this phase using only “PowerPoint” or “Excel,” meaning basing the analysis on someone’s opinion or “industry best practices.”

Now let’s consider a specific example: _**An e-commerce company that sells a variety of products to customers**_.

**2.1 Data Collection and Integration**

The first step is to collect and integrate a representative data sample from various sources. This could include transaction data, customer demographic data, website/app browsing data, customer feedback, social media interactions, etc. As per the point made in the last section, we would gather a strategic selected sample of each data point, and ensure the team doing the analysis have the right access.

Here, it is very important to get a holistic picture of the current customer experience touch points with our company, from the consideration stage to the purchase and post-purchase stages. And don’t forget to avoid survival bias!

**2.2 Data Modeling**

Next, the data is used to create a graph that maps out the relationships between different entities. For example:

* Customers could be linked to the products they’ve bought (customer-product relationships).
* Customers could also be linked to other customers if they’ve interacted on social media or through product reviews (customer-customer relationships).
* Products could be linked to other products if they’re frequently bought together (product-product relationships).

**2.3 Data Analysis and Insights Extraction**

We can then use AI algorithms to analyze this graph and extract insights. For example:

* Community detection algorithms could be used to identify clusters of customers with similar buying behaviors. This could then be used to develop personalized marketing strategies.
* Pathfinding algorithms could be used to understand the customer journey and identify common paths to purchase. This could inform website or app redesigns to optimize the user experience.
* Predictive analytics could be used to forecast future customer behaviors and inform business strategy.

Here, it is also very important to bring the ideas mentioned in the first chapters about Product Management methodology. For example, the “jobs-to-be-done” methodology could be used to challenge the end purpose of the customers, and whether we have now the right data needed to help the customer accomplish their jobs. Another important point, as we only have a subset of the full data, we need to ensure that whatever we do, it will scale, and it is representative of the full picture.

**2.4 Business Model Development**

After the high-level valuation of the first stage, it is now time to start developing a robust business model for data monetization which will be crucial for ensuring long-term success. Organizations must carefully consider the key elements of their business model, including cost-benefit analysis and return on investment (ROI) calculations. The following steps outline the process to create a business model:

1.  a.

    **Define the value proposition**: Clearly articulate the value that your data or AI-driven solution provides to customers. This includes identifying the target market, understanding customer needs, and determining how your solution addresses those needs.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Determine the pricing model**: Establish a pricing model for your data or AI-driven product or service, considering factors such as the value provided, market demand, and competitive landscape. Common pricing models include subscription-based pricing, tiered pricing, and usage-based pricing.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Calculate costs and ROI**: Conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to understand the costs associated with data monetization efforts, including data storage, processing, and analytics, as well as the development and maintenance of AI solutions. Compare these costs to the expected revenue generated to determine the ROI and ensure the sustainability of your data monetization efforts. Make sure you factor in the cost of data governance and compliance procedures, and also the operation, especially if there is not a current MLOps – as the people needed and infrastructure are different.

    &#x20;

A critical stage in business model development is to understand market demand and the competitive landscape. By analyzing these factors, organizations can identify the most promising opportunities for data monetization and develop a strategy that differentiates them from competitors. Key aspects of market demand and competitive landscape analysis include

1.  a.

    **Market size and growth**: Assess the overall size and growth potential of the market for the data products or services the organization aims to offer. This analysis can help organizations determine if there is sufficient demand to support their data monetization efforts.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Customer segmentation**: Identify the target customer segments for the organization’s data products or services. This analysis can help organizations tailor their offerings to the specific needs and preferences of different customer groups, increasing the value of their data assets.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Competitor analysis**: Evaluate the competitive landscape by identifying key competitors in the market, their offerings, strengths, and weaknesses. This analysis can help organizations identify opportunities to differentiate their data products or services and develop a unique value proposition.

    &#x20;
4.  d.

    **Pricing strategies**: Analyze pricing strategies used by competitors and assess the willingness of target customers to pay for the organization’s data products or services. This analysis can help organizations develop pricing models that maximize revenue while remaining competitive.

    &#x20;

#### 3. Scale and Repeat

The final stage of the framework, once you have successfully proven the value of a data monetization initiative, is to Scale and Repeat.

Scaling involves taking a successful prototype and building it out into a full-fledged, operational solution. You should ensure that your solution can handle increased data volumes, user load, and integrate with other business systems as needed.

Furthermore, the solution should not just be technically scalable but also organizationally adopted. This might involve training employees, adjusting business processes, and aligning the initiative with broader strategic objectives.

Once you have successfully scaled one initiative, the process repeats. You go back to the value exploration stage for the next potential data monetization opportunity, and so the cycle continues. The ultimate aim is to create a data-driven culture of continuous learning and innovation, where AI and data monetization become integral parts of your business strategy.

**3.1 Defining Clear Objectives and Use Cases**

Once the organization’s data assets have been assessed and prepared, the next step is to define clear objectives and use cases for data monetization. This involves

1.  a.

    **Aligning with business goals**: Ensure that the organization’s data monetization efforts align with its overall business goals and strategy. This may involve identifying specific revenue targets, cost savings, or market opportunities that can be addressed through data monetization.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Identifying use cases**: Develop a list of potential use cases for data monetization, based on the organization’s business goals, customer needs, and competitive landscape. These use cases should be prioritized based on their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the organization’s strategic objectives.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Defining success metrics**: Establish clear metrics and KPIs that will be used to measure the success of the organization’s data monetization efforts. These metrics should be directly linked to the organization’s business goals and should be measurable, achievable, and relevant.

    &#x20;

**3.2 Developing a Data Monetization Roadmap**

With clear objectives and use cases in place, the next step is to develop a data monetization roadmap. This involves

1.  a.

    **Prioritizing use cases**: Rank the identified use cases based on their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the organization’s strategic objectives. This prioritization will help guide the allocation of resources and investment in data monetization initiatives.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Defining a timeline**: Establish a timeline for implementing the prioritized use cases, considering the organization’s resource constraints, technological capabilities, and market dynamics.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Identifying required resources**: Assess the resources required to implement the data monetization roadmap, including technical infrastructure, data science expertise, and cross-functional collaboration. This may involve upskilling existing employees, hiring new talent, or partnering with external vendors and service providers.

    &#x20;

**3.3 Implementing AI-Powered Solutions**

With a data monetization roadmap in place, the next step is to implement AI-powered solutions that can extract actionable insights from the organization’s data assets.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.**Model architecture, parameters, and training**: The construction and refinement of AI models, which includes

    1.  a.

        **Feature engineering**: Identifying and creating useful features for AI models, which can involve aggregating data, creating derived variables, or using dimensionality reduction techniques.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Model development and validation**: Developing and validating AI models using preprocessed data and selected features, which might involve selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning model parameters, and evaluating model performance.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **Model deployment and integration**: Implementing the AI models into existing systems for seamless integration and scalability. This could involve APIs, cloud-based platforms, or containerization technologies.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        **Continuous improvement**: Ongoing performance monitoring of AI models and refining them based on feedback and changing business needs.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Action and interaction**: Using insights from data analysis to enhance interactions with customers. For example, a customer identified as a frequent buyer of specific products may receive personalized recommendations for similar items, or a common purchase path could lead to a more user-friendly website design.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Feedback loop**: The results of these actions are fed back into the data collection stage, creating a self-improving cycle. For instance, a positive response to a personalized product recommendation validates the cluster analysis and informs future recommendations, while a website redesign that boosts conversion rates confirms the identified purchase path and informs future redesigns.

    &#x20;

The ultimate goal of this framework is a continuous cycle of data collection, analysis, action, and feedback, continually improving customer interactions and boosting both customer satisfaction and business performance.

**3.4 Measuring Success and Refining the Strategy**

The final step in the data monetization framework is to measure the success of the implemented AI-powered solutions and refine the organization’s data monetization strategy. This involves

1.  a.

    **Tracking metrics and KPIs**: Regularly track and report on the established success metrics and KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness of the organization’s data monetization efforts. This should include quantitative measures, such as revenue generation, cost savings, and customer satisfaction, as well as qualitative assessments, such as employee engagement and cultural change.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    **Identifying lessons learned**: Analyze the organization’s data monetization efforts to identify lessons learned, best practices, and areas for improvement. This may involve conducting post-mortems, soliciting feedback from stakeholders, and benchmarking against industry peers.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    **Refining the strategy**: Based on the insights gained from measuring success and identifying lessons learned, refine the organization’s data monetization strategy to better align with its business goals, customer needs, and competitive landscape. This may involve reprioritizing use cases, reallocating resources, or exploring new technologies and techniques.

    &#x20;

The framework outlined above provides a structured approach for organizations to unlock value from their data assets using AI. Organizations can systematically monetize their data, generate revenue, and create lasting business value, when they follow these three main areas.

#### Challenges and Risks in Data Monetization
