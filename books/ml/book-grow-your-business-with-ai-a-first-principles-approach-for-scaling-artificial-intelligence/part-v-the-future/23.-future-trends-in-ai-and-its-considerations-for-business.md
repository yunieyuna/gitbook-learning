# 23. Future Trends in AI and Its Considerations for Business

The rapidly evolving landscape of AI technologies has brought forth a wave of unprecedented advancements in various domains. As we progress further into the 21st century, businesses must not only adapt to the current AI landscape but also anticipate and prepare for its future direction. This ability to foresee potential changes and harness emerging technologies will be the key to maintaining a competitive edge in an increasingly data-driven world.

### “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1)

Most businesses which are not directly in the AI industry might be thinking: “why should I worry about how AI technology might evolve; it is not my core business.” However, looking at history as the famous quote from Churchill, we can say this is quite a risky approach. In the constantly evolving landscape of technology, failing to anticipate, adapt to, and adopt transformational emerging innovations can mean the difference between thriving and disappearing. Let’s look at _**the demise of the ice industry**_, which serves as an instructive case study.

The ice industry, at the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th, was a booming business. Companies, such as the _**Knickerbocker**_[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) Ice Company in the United States, capitalized on the demand for ice by owning frozen lakes and cutting massive ice blocks during the winter months, as shown in Figure [23-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1). These blocks were then transported to cities where they were used for refrigeration in an era before modern refrigerators. These companies were large and prosperous, with the Knickerbocker Ice Company reportedly employing over 1,000 horses and over 100 wagons for transportation alone, becoming a pillar of the economy in the region.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_23_Chapter/605840_1_En_23_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="844" width="1063"><figcaption><p>Figure 23-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

However, their dominance was short-lived. The advent of electrical refrigeration technology in the early 20th century marked the beginning of the end for the traditional ice industry. Companies that produced these new refrigeration units, such as Frigidaire[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4) and General Electric, offered a more convenient, reliable, and efficient method of food preservation and cooling. Suddenly, the logistics-heavy business of harvesting and transporting natural ice was no longer necessary.

Interestingly, the ice industry failed not because it couldn’t have adapted to this new technology, but primarily because it didn’t. The vast majority of these ice companies saw themselves in the business of harvesting and distributing natural ice, not in the broader business of refrigeration. As a result, they did not invest in the burgeoning field of _**artificial refrigeration**_, allowing other companies to seize the opportunity.

This tale of the ice industry offers a stark warning for modern businesses: the cost of failing to keep an eye on future development of foundational technologies can be fatal. As AI evolves at a breakneck speed, businesses must stay alert to technological changes and prepare to pivot their strategies. If they do not, they risk going the way of the ice companies – becoming obsolete and outpaced by those who do embrace the new. In the age of AI, understanding the _**broader context of your business – not just the specifics of your current operation –**_ will be critical to long-term survival and success.

Today, companies which core business models rely on information management are exposed to a fundamental revolution; AI capabilities can completely transform their industry. Many companies in the data business should remember that the clients/consumers are trying to achieve a task with their data, but the actual data is not the end, only a means to the end “job-to-be-done.” And using AI, specially generative AI models, it is possible to achieve many tasks without using some of the existing datasets.

As AI technologies become more sophisticated and integrated into various processes, companies that successfully leverage these advancements will reap the benefits of increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and enhanced innovation.

One critical aspect of preparing for the future of AI is staying informed about emerging trends and potential breakthroughs. By keeping a finger on the pulse of AI advancements, business leaders can make informed decisions about adopting new technologies, investing in research and development, and upskilling their workforce.Table 23-1&#x20;

### Quantum Computing and AI

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, offering unprecedented computational power and speed. By leveraging the core principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computers can solve certain complex problems far more efficiently than classical computers. Contrary to popular belief, quantum computing are not just super-fast classical computers, there work differently, and they are able to solve some problems in less time than classical computers, but they do it by operating differently rather than performing the same task as the classical computer quicker. Indeed, by harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, quantum computers can solve some problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. This could lead to major breakthroughs in areas such as drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_23_Chapter/605840_1_En_23_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="555" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 23-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

See the following core principles of quantum computers. For the more curious reader, I gave a full introduction to the topic in a developers’ conference.[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5) There is also a great book[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn6) for those would like to get far deeper into the details:

* **Qubits vs bits**: As per Figure [23-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2), classical computers encode information as binary digits, or bits, which can take on one of two values, 0 or 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits. A qubit can exist in a state corresponding to 0 or 1, or in any superposition of these states.
* **Entanglement**: This is a quantum phenomenon where the state of one particle becomes linked to the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. In terms of quantum computing, when qubits become entangled, the state of one qubit will correlate with the state of another, enabling complex calculations to be performed more efficiently than classical computers.
* **Quantum gates**: Just as classical computers use logic gates to perform operations on bits, quantum computers use quantum gates to perform operations on qubits. However, unlike classical gates, quantum gates are reversible and involve complex numbers. They operate by changing the probabilities and phases of the quantum states.
* **Quantum superposition**: As mentioned earlier, a qubit can exist not just in a state corresponding to the logical state 0 or 1 as in a classical bit, but also in states that are superpositions of these. This means that a qubit can exist in multiple states at once, allowing it to perform multiple computations simultaneously.
* **Quantum error correction**: Quantum error correction is a technique used to protect qubits from errors. Errors can occur due to noise in the environment or due to interactions between qubits. Quantum error correction can be used to keep qubits in a consistent state and to prevent errors from accumulating.
* **Quantum algorithms**: Quantum algorithms are the programs that are run on quantum computers. They are designed to take advantage of the power of quantum computing to perform calculations that are impossible for classical computers. This is one of the areas with the most potential.

One of the most promising applications of quantum computing in AI is quantum machine learning (QML). QML algorithms can potentially process large datasets and optimize models much faster than their classical counterparts. This enhanced capability can lead to significant breakthroughs in various industries, including drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling.Table 23-2&#x20;

Potential applications of quantum computing in AI

| Industry          | Application                                | Impact                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drug discovery    | Molecular simulations, drug design         | Accelerated development of new treatments and therapies  |
| Materials science | Material property prediction, optimization | Discovery of advanced materials for various applications |
| Finance           | Portfolio optimization, risk management    | Improved decision-making and financial forecasting       |

In drug discovery, for example, quantum computing can help simulate the behavior of molecules and chemical reactions, enabling researchers to identify new compounds and predict their effectiveness more accurately (see Table [23-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)). This can expedite the development of novel drugs and therapies, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.

Despite its enormous potential, there are several challenges and opportunities in harnessing quantum computing for AI. Some of these challenges include the current limitations in quantum hardware, the need for specialized quantum algorithms, and the integration of quantum computing with existing systems.

Quantum computing holds significant promise for the future of AI, with potential applications in various industries, such as drug discovery, materials science, and finance. Although there are challenges to overcome, businesses that stay informed about quantum computing advancements and invest in research can reap the benefits of this cutting-edge technology.

#### Bioengineering: Merging Biology with AI for Future Devices

When it comes to exploring the limits of computing, it is very useful to go to First Principles and remember from Chapter [6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml) the comparison of biological vs silicon brains. In the quest for a better computing future, we need to look no further than our own brains. A marvel of biological engineering, the human brain is a supercomputer in its own right, outperforming even the most powerful silicon-based machines in terms of efficiency. While it is estimated that the world’s fastest supercomputer consumes around 20 megawatts to perform at its peak, the human brain does similar computational work using approximately 20 watts. This is about as much energy as a dim light bulb consumes, compared to 20 Mwatts, which could provide energy to a small city of around 10,000 homes for a year. Figure [23-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) shows a comparison from first principles (power-efficiency) between biological and silicon computing.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_23_Chapter/605840_1_En_23_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="926" width="945"><figcaption><p>Figure 23-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

Such efficiency results from the brain’s fundamentally different computing architecture. Instead of separate memory and processing units, the brain’s billions of neurons and trillions of synapses concurrently store and process information. In essence, the brain is an analog computer, where computations occur in parallel, unlike in digital machines where computations are largely sequential. This has inspired a new wave of research in AI, focusing on building neuro-mimetic or neuromorphic devices that emulate the brain’s.

_**Enter bioengineering**_, and more specifically, the revolutionary gene-editing tool, CRISPR. CRISPR enables precise modifications in the genetic code, making it possible to engineer biological organisms and systems at an unprecedented scale and detail. Leveraging CRISPR in conjunction with AI, we could potentially design hybrid bio-silicon devices that combine the high-speed processing power of silicon chips with the energy efficiency of biological systems.

There are many ways this could be achieved. For example, researchers might use CRISPR[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn7) to genetically engineer neurons to respond to light, effectively creating an interface between the digital and biological world. By linking these modified neurons with silicon chips, we could create a device that uses light signals to perform computations, similar to how neurons in our brains use electrical signals.

It’s not just about creating efficient computers, though. Such hybrid devices could also revolutionize areas like drug discovery, environmental sensing, and even artificial tissue and organ growth. For instance, imagine an AI system that can guide the growth of complex biological structures, like human organs, for transplantation.

While this future is exciting, it is not without its challenges. Ethical considerations are paramount when dealing with genetic manipulation and blending biological and artificial systems. Regulatory frameworks must be put in place to guide these advancements responsibly, considering both the potential benefits and risks.

However, the potential is clear. By harnessing the power of bioengineering and AI, we could not only create devices that surpass the efficiency of today’s computers but also open the door to a myriad of applications that could revolutionize industries and society as a whole. The future of AI and bioengineering combined is promising, if navigated judiciously, can bring unprecedented benefits to the world

#### AGI Research Areas

As we saw in earlier chapters, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents highly autonomous systems that can outperform humans in the most economically valuable work. It is an area of research that aims to create machines that exhibit general intelligence similar to human intelligence. Here are the core components of AGI research from a first principles point of view:

* **Learning**: AGIs need to be able to learn from their environment. This means they need to be able to acquire new knowledge and skills, and they need to be able to adapt to new situations.
* **Reasoning**: AGIs need to be able to reason about their environment; they need to be able to make inferences, draw conclusions, and solve problems.
* **Decision-making**: AGIs need to be able to make decisions. This means they need to be able to weigh the pros and cons of different options, and they need to be able to choose the best option for a given situation.

Current AI systems do not exhibit behaviors in these three areas and might excel at one of them but not the others. It is expected we will need to solve all three. Here are the core areas of research involved:

* **World models**: World models are representations of the world that AGIs can use to reason about their environment. World models can be created by training an AGI on a large dataset of sensory data.[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn8)
* **Neural networks and deep learning**: AGI research builds heavily on advancements in deep learning and neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the human brain. Deep learning algorithms learn to recognize patterns and make decisions by being trained on large datasets.
* **Deep reinforcement learning**: Deep reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that allows AGIs to learn how to behave in complex environments by trial and error. Deep reinforcement learning has been used to train AGIs to play games like Go and Dota 2.
* **Neuromorphic computing**: Neuromorphic computing is a type of computing that is inspired by the way the human brain works. Neuromorphic computing could be used to create AGIs that are more efficient and more energy-efficient than traditional computers.
* **Causal inference**: Understanding cause-effect relationships is a crucial aspect of human intelligence that’s largely missing in current AI models. Researchers like Yoshua Bengio[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn9) are focusing on this area, seeking to build machines that understand the underlying causal structure of the world.
* **Symbolic reasoning**: While current AI excels at pattern recognition, it struggles with high-level, abstract reasoning. The integration of symbolic reasoning with neural networks (neurosymbolic AI) addresses this.
* **AI safety and ethics**: As we move closer to AGI, issues of safety and ethics become increasingly important. This involves designing systems that behave as intended and are aligned with human values, and also considering the broader societal impacts of AGI.
* **Meta-learning and self-supervised learning**: Meta-learning, or learning to learn, involves building systems that can improve their own learning algorithms based on experience. Self-supervised learning, on the other hand, involves models learning from raw, unlabeled data.
* **Natural language processing (NLP**): The ability to understand, generate, and respond to human language is a key aspect of AGI. OpenAI’s GPT-3 is a major breakthrough in this area.

It’s important to note that these areas are not distinct but rather closely intertwined. Achieving AGI will likely require significant progress and integration across all these areas. It is also important to note that we do not have a clear path to AGI, and plenty of different (and often strong!) views in the fields. For instance, some researchers think you only need deep learning to achieve AGI, just need to improve the architectures and keep adding more layers and data to do it effectively. And the success of ChatGPT and other LLM might provide an evidence point in this direction. However, there are also another group of researchers who strongly disagree with this view, saying that you really need to have an internal “world view” that cannot be simply learned by using massive deep learning network. Time will tell who is right.

### Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices, such as computers or prosthetic limbs (Figure [23-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)). BCIs have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, from assisting people with disabilities to enhancing cognitive capabilities and enabling new forms of human-machine interaction.

AI plays a crucial role in the development of BCIs, as machine learning algorithms can be used to interpret the complex neural signals generated by the brain and translate them into meaningful commands for external devices. Moreover, AI can be used to improve the accuracy, reliability, and responsiveness of BCIs, making them more practical and accessible for everyday use.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_23_Chapter/605840_1_En_23_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="867" width="1299"><figcaption><p>Figure 23-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

Potential applications of BCIs include

* **Medical and rehabilitation**: BCIs can be used to help people with disabilities regain control over their bodies, such as controlling prosthetic limbs or wheelchair navigation. Additionally, BCIs can be used to facilitate communication for people with severe speech or motor impairments.
* **Human augmentation**: BCIs have the potential to enhance human cognitive capabilities, such as memory, attention, or problem-solving. For example, AI-powered BCIs could be used to augment human decision-making in high-stress environments, such as military operations or emergency situations.
* **Entertainment and gaming**: BCIs can be used to create more immersive and interactive gaming experiences, enabling players to control virtual environments using only their thoughts.
* **Workplace productivity**: BCIs could be integrated into workplace environments to improve productivity, such as enabling workers to control computers or machinery using their thoughts or enhancing focus and concentration during complex tasks.
* **BCIs could be used to create new types of AI** that are able to interact with the world in new ways. For example, BCIs could be used to create AI that is able to control robots or other machines, or that is able to communicate with other people using their thoughts.
* **BCIs could be used to improve the performance of existing AI systems**. For example, BCIs could be used to give AI systems access to more information, such as the user’s thoughts and feelings. This could help AI systems to make better decisions and to learn more effectively.
* **BCIs could raise ethical concerns**. For example, some people worry that BCIs could be used to control people’s thoughts or to manipulate their behavior. It is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of BCIs before they are widely used.

The field is moving quickly and at the time of writing the FDA just approved human trials to Neuralink.[11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn11) Once again, multiple trends developing in parallel could converge to unexpected new technologies. This is another area to keep an active eye on it.

Harnessing the potential of AI in these key areas (Table [23-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_23\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3)) will require concerted efforts from businesses, governments, and societies. As AI continues to evolve, businesses will need to adapt their strategies to embrace the transformative potential of AI while managing associated risks.

### Enhancing Business Efficacy: Human-AI Synergy and Augmentation

Artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to shape workplaces and societies in unprecedented ways. This chapter focuses on the enhancement of human capabilities and decision-making through AI integration, the fostering of effective human-AI collaboration, and risk mitigation strategies.

#### The Human-AI Evolution in the Workplace and Society

AI’s incorporation in numerous industries and societal sectors has the potential to improve human performance and empower decision-making. This transformative relationship between humans and AI can be classified into three primary stages:
