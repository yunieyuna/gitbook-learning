### The Future of AI Seen Through the Eyes of a 12-Year-Old Female Y8 Student

So, I’ve been asked to tell you all about what a twelve-year-old thinks about AI. Yes, you heard it right, a twelve-year-old. And no, I’m not just going to talk about robot teachers (Figure [22-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)) and self-tying shoes (although those would be helpful don’t you think?)

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="885" width="885"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

AI is transforming society right before our eyes. I mean, have you ever thought about how incredible it is that we can just talk to our phones, and they can answer us? But I’m not just thinking about talking phones or walking robots. No, no. I’m thinking about how AI could help design our future homes, cities, and skyscrapers.

As a budding architect or interior designer, I can’t help but get a bit starry-eyed imagining the possibilities. With AI, I could create digital designs of buildings, and maybe even whole cities (Figure [22-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)), before a single brick is laid. I mean, how cool is that?

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="945" width="945"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

But hold on a sec! It’s not all roses and rainbows, right? I mean, what happens to the builders, the carpenters, the masons? And then there’s the issue of military AI. I’ve seen enough movies to know that when you combine robots and weapons, things can get a bit messy.

So, my vision for AI is a bit of a mixed bag. I’m excited, of course, but also a bit cautious. We need to make sure we’re creating a world that’s fair and safe for everyone. After all, we don’t want a world that’s just awesome for the architects; we want a world that’s awesome for everyone!

Alright, I’m off to doodle a blueprint for my AI-assisted dream treehouse. Catch you on the other side!

### The Future of AI Seen Through the Eyes of a 16-Year-Old Male A-Level Student

In a world that feels more like an ongoing season of Black Mirror, with self-driving cars and home-assistant Alexa that seems to know more about my school schedule than I do, it’s hard not to get a bit thrilled and scared about how AI will further infiltrate our lives. So let’s get down to it; let me give you my piece of 16-year-old wisdom about what I think AI’s future looks like.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="788" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

AI’s impact on society? Well, imagine a society where no one has to do the dishes, fight over the remote, or figure out who is doing the laundry. I’m talking about AI-run households and people! Now that’s a future I can get behind. Of course, I am biased since I am regularly on laundry duty at home. But seriously, the possibilities of AI in our everyday lives are mind-boggling and not just because they save us from chores. Improved healthcare, personalized education, streamlined transportation, the list goes on (Figure [22-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)).

Now, about my career plans. Yes, I’m seriously considering a life in the armed forces. No, not because of the snappy uniforms but because I see AI’s potential to revolutionize defense strategies and enhance our country’s security. Think about AI-powered drones for surveillance, cyber defense systems, and even robotic soldiers (Figure [22-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)). It’s kind of like an action movie, isn’t it?

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1004" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

But before you think I’m completely starry-eyed, let me assure you that I do have concerns. I sometimes lie awake at night wondering if AI would make humans obsolete. What happens to employment when jobs are automated? How do we ensure that AI doesn’t widen the social divide? And more importantly, who’s going to regulate the AI – a teenager who can’t even be trusted to do his laundry regularly?

Yes, we have to be cautious, like any good action movie, there’s a potential villain lurking – the impact of AI on employment, politics, and societal structures. We’ve all heard of AI potentially taking jobs, but how about AI in politics? Could AI lead to better decision-making, or would it create a new form of divide – those who have access to AI and those who don’t?

Moreover, how would AI reshape our society? Would we live in a utopian world where everything is efficient and smooth, or a dystopian one where our every move is watched and analyzed? It’s like the plot of a good book, where you’re both excited and anxious to turn the next page.

So, here’s my take on the future of AI – a mix of high hopes, a dash of humor, and a dollop of healthy caution. And if this has got you pondering, I’ve done my job. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to debate the future of politics with my AI-powered home assistant. Wish me luck!

### The Future of AI Seen Through the Eyes of a 16-Year-Old Female A-Level Student

Growing up in an increasingly digital world, I, as a 16-year-old A-Level student in the UK, am marveling at the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI). I envision a future where AI could revolutionize society, influencing our careers, personal lives, and even our interaction with the natural world. At the same time, I acknowledge that this promise of progress is not without its pitfalls. Critical among my concerns is the potential impact of AI on privacy, security, and ethical standards.

In my view, AI holds a transformative potential for virtually every facet of our lives. AI-powered automation could relieve us of mundane tasks, freeing us up for more creative and meaningful endeavors. As an animal welfare enthusiast, I’m excited about the prospects of integrating AI into wildlife conservation efforts. With AI and data analytics, we could track endangered species more effectively, anticipate threats more accurately, and devise more strategic countermeasures (Figure [22-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="788" width="1182"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

However, the AI-powered future we are advancing toward is not without its challenges. Among my greatest concerns is privacy, an aspect that could fundamentally be altered with increased reliance on AI. The data-intensive nature of AI systems poses a significant risk to personal privacy. With companies and governments able to collect, analyze, and store vast amounts of personal data, there’s a real danger of misuse, be it intentional or accidental.

For example, personalized advertisements, while convenient, often come from companies collecting and analyzing your online behavior. On a more ominous note, the data we generate can be harnessed to influence our behavior or even predict our actions, a concept known as “predictive policing” in law enforcement circles. While there’s a potential benefit in terms of security, it’s a step toward a surveillance state if unchecked.

So, how do we strike a balance? How do we ensure that the benefits of AI are realized without trampling on individual privacy rights? The answer lies in a robust and forward-thinking regulatory framework that respects privacy while enabling innovation. Policies need to ensure that data is collected and used ethically, with explicit user consent, and only for stated purposes.

As we navigate this AI-enhanced future, it’s important to balance the immense potential of AI with the need to protect privacy and uphold ethical standards. By integrating policy, technology, and ethics, we can create an AI-enabled world that respects individual rights while advancing society as a whole. As a young adult stepping into this brave new world, I’m optimistic about our ability to shape this technology for the greater good.

### The Future of AI Seen Through the Eyes of a 19-Year-Old Male Student

Okay, so here’s the lowdown. I’m 19. No longer a kid but not quite the sage adult. Yet, for whatever reason, folks want to know what I think about AI. Well, buckle up, because I’m about to throw some hard truths at you (interspersed with the odd funny, of course).

Firstly, let’s talk about AI in my future industry: aeronautical engineering. This isn’t just “buzzword bingo”; AI has some serious potential here. I’m talking autonomous aircraft, predictive maintenance, optimizing flight paths, the whole nine yards (Figure [22-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)). AI could, quite literally, help us reach for the stars.

However, I’m not oblivious to the issues. Like the need for trust, for instance. As someone who would love nothing more than to work with AI in aircraft, the prospect of an error in the code causing a tragic accident is quite sobering. We need to ensure safety and robustness in our AI systems.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_22_Chapter/605840_1_En_22_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1064" width="709"><figcaption><p>Figure 22-6 </p></figcaption></figure>

Then there’s the societal cost. Just because we can implement AI everywhere, does it mean we should? And how do we make sure that the AI revolution isn’t just benefiting the fat cats at the top, but everyone?

Picture this – AI revolutionizing sports, Rugby, in particular. Imagine sensors in rugby balls, player tracking, and strategies enhanced with AI – a total game-changer, right?

Finally, there’s the whole matter of societal norms. Will AI redefine our norms? Could it even create new ones? It’s a conundrum alright. I don’t have the answers, but these are the questions that keep me up at night.

To fully realize the potential of AI, we need to focus on developing AI-based modeling techniques that can build automated, intelligent, and smart systems. These models should be analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual, to enable computers and machines to perform cognitive functions such as problem-solving, decision making, perception, and comprehension of human communication. We also need to ensure that AI is developed and implemented in an ethical and responsible manner, with a focus on transparency, accountability, and fairness.

So, as a 19-year-old future aeronautical engineer, that’s my two cents on the future of AI. It’s a complex picture, with plenty of exciting opportunities, but also significant challenges. As the saying goes, “with great power comes great responsibility.” It’s clear that AI is a great power; now we just need to make sure we handle it responsibly.

### Chapter Summary/Key Takeaways

As we journeyed through Chapter [22](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_22\_Chapter.xhtml), it was a refreshing exercise to immerse ourselves in the perspectives of four distinct youth voices. Through their anticipations and concerns, we gained invaluable insights into how AI might shape our world in the years to come.

This chapter delved into the visions of four children, each contemplating their futures amidst the rapid advancement of AI. The 12-year-old architect-to-be saw a world where AI unleashes unparalleled creativity in her chosen field. Meanwhile, the twin 16-year-olds, one planning to join the armed forces, another an animal welfare enthusiast, looked at AI as both a formidable force in defense and a tool to protect and preserve animal life. Lastly, our 19-year-old aeronautical engineering aspirant projected AI’s influence on his industry and sport, simultaneously wrestling with ethical, societal, and safety concerns.

We have seen the following key points raised throughout the chapter:

* Younger generations are more familiar with AI than older generations.
* Younger generations see AI as a tool that can be used to solve problems and improve their lives.
* Younger generations are aware of the potential risks of AI, but they believe that the benefits outweigh the risks.
* There are challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that AI is used for good.
