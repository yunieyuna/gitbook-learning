# 14. Organization and Governance

In the era of digital transformation, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a critical tool in driving innovation, enhancing competitiveness, and improving efficiency across industries. The adoption of AI, however, is not just about employing the right technology, but also about assembling the right team and establishing robust governance structures. This sets the stage for our discussion about the significance of structured AI teams and the role of governance in successful AI implementation.

As we saw in Chapter [4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml), many of the barriers to implementing AI are related to the teams being involved rather than the actual technology. This is the reason why this chapter is so important – it is not enough just to hire a few new data scientists and acquire some licenses for some trendy AI/MLOps software, the right governance and team structure are critical, they will be different for each company, and they would also have to evolve as the company AI maturity evolves over time.

I have seen the terms sometimes confused, so it is worth going into the details. Having a strong governance does not necessarily provide the right organization and the other way round.

Note&#x20;

Governance provides the rules and guidelines for AI usage, ensuring it is responsible, ethical, compliant, and effective. Organization, on the other hand, is about the practical setup of teams and resources to get the AI project done, including live operation, efficiently and effectively. Both are critical for successful AI implementation.

Governance in the context of AI projects typically refers to the framework, rules, policies, and procedures that are in place to manage the development, deployment, use, and monitoring of AI systems. These can include elements such as

* **Data governance**: Establishing rules for data collection, storage, access, and usage to foster privacy, security, ethics, and compliance with legal norms.
* **Model governance**: This includes processes for model development, validation, deployment, and maintenance.
* **Ethical governance**: This includes ensuring that AI is used responsibly and ethically, considering bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability.
* **Risk management**: Identifying and managing risks related to AI use, such as cybersecurity threats, misuse of AI, etc.

On the other hand, the organization in the context of AI projects typically refers to the way teams and resources are structured and managed to successfully execute the project. This can include factors like

* **Team structure**: This refers to roles and responsibilities within the project team. Who are the data scientists, engineers, project managers, etc., and what are their responsibilities?
* **Collaboration**: How are teams or individuals collaborating? What systems and tools are in place to facilitate this?
* **Resource allocation**: This includes how resources like time, budget, and personnel are allocated across different tasks or parts of the project.
* **Project management**: This includes the processes and methodologies used to manage the project, such as agile or waterfall methods.

The rise of AI projects in business has led to the creation of new roles and teams, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI product managers, and data engineers, among others. These roles are crucial to the design, development, deployment, and management of AI projects. However, the effectiveness of these teams is contingent on having a clear organizational structure.

A well-structured team fosters collaboration, efficiency, and innovation. A 2020 McKinsey[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1) survey revealed that companies with clear AI team structures were twice as likely to report significant benefits from AI adoption than those with ad hoc or no AI team structure.

Similarly, governance plays an equally crucial role in AI projects. Governance provides a framework for decision-making, guiding the development and management of AI projects, ensuring ethical and legal compliance, and facilitating transparency and accountability.

A 2021 Deloitte study[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) found that companies with an enterprise-wide AI strategy and leadership who communicate a bold vision are nearly 1.5 times more likely to achieve high outcomes (Table [14-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 14-1&#x20;

The impact of structure and governance on AI success

| Factor              | Impact on AI success                                                                                      | Key data points                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured AI teams | Promotes collaboration, efficiency, and innovation                                                        | Companies with clear AI team structures were twice as likely to report significant benefits from AI adoption (McKinsey, 2020) |
| AI governance       | Guides decision-making, ensures ethical and legal compliance, facilitates transparency and accountability | Companies with effective AI governance were 1.5 times more likely to be “high-performing companies” (Deloitte, 2021)          |

In conclusion, effective organization and governance are not ancillary considerations but are fundamental to the successful implementation of AI projects. The next sections of this chapter will delve deeper into the specifics of organizing AI teams and establishing an AI governance framework, aiming to provide you with a blueprint for building a robust and productive AI culture in your organization. As we progress, we will further explore these concepts through concrete examples and real-world case studies, ensuring a practical understanding of these critical areas.

### Organization in AI Teams

The growth of AI in the business sector necessitates teams specialized in data science, machine learning, and AI product management, among other roles. The organization of these teams and understanding their roles and responsibilities is vital to the success of any AI project.

Organizing AI teams effectively is a crucial aspect of implementing AI in a company. In this subsection, we will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of various team structures, provide recommendations for effective communication and collaboration, and emphasize the importance of cross-functional teams to drive business value.

#### Understanding the Key Roles

In most organizations, an AI team comprises four key roles:

* **Data scientists**: They create predictive models, develop machine learning algorithms, and perform statistical analysis. They use data to provide business insights and recommendations.
* **Machine learning engineers**: They focus on coding and deploying the models that data scientists create into production environments. Their work is more software-oriented than data scientists. A particular role here is the **MLOps engineer** – we expand on those later on.
* **AI product managers**: They act as a bridge between the AI team and the rest of the business. They manage the AI product roadmap, prioritize features, and ensure that the AI team’s work aligns with business objectives.
* **Data engineers**: They are responsible for building and maintaining the data infrastructure. They ensure data is collected, stored, and prepared for use by data scientists and machine learning engineers.

#### The Role of a Data Scientist

Data scientists play crucial roles in AI teams, and the specifics of these roles can vary significantly depending on the context and needs of the organization. Broadly, we can categorize data scientist roles into two types: research and development (R\&D) focused and applied.

R\&D data scientists are typically found in academic settings or large tech companies with substantial research divisions. Their work often involves developing novel algorithms or enhancing existing ones, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in machine learning and AI.

In contrast, applied data scientists are typically more focused on utilizing existing algorithms to solve real-world problems. They deploy models to extract insights from data, make predictions, automate decisions, or build intelligent applications. The vast majority of data science roles in industry fall into this latter category.

Nevertheless, many companies get confused, and sometimes they recruit as if they were to develop new algorithms, but then demand from data science teams’ immediate returns. A good analogy is explained by Cassie Kozyrkov, Google’s Chief Decision Scientist, in her article “Why businesses fail at machine learning”[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3).

This does not mean that applied data scientists are merely applying algorithms developed by others without any understanding. Instead, it’s like a chef using a microwave. The chef does not need to know the intricate details of how the microwave was built, but they do need to understand how to use it effectively, such as how to adjust the power levels, timing, and other settings to cook food properly.

Similarly, while applied data scientists might not be developing groundbreaking machine learning algorithms from scratch, they need to know how to properly use, adjust, and evaluate these algorithms, ensuring they are effectively applied to solve business problems.

Lastly, it’s important to note that building a proficient data science team can be quite challenging. Not only is there a high demand for skilled data scientists, but there’s also a surprising number of professionals in the field who have never put models into production. This gap in experience can make it difficult to find data scientists who are not only adept at building models but also at deploying them, monitoring their performance, and iterating on them in a real-world environment. Therefore, when building a data science team, it’s important to look for experience with all stages of the data science lifecycle, not just model development.

#### Structuring Your AI Teams

When it comes to structuring your AI teams, companies generally opt for either a centralized or decentralized model, or a hybrid of the two. In a centralized model, all AI initiatives are led by a single, core team. In a decentralized model, each department or business unit has its own AI team.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_14_Chapter/605840_1_En_14_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="854" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 14-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

As we can see in Figure [14-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1), the AI organization can be grouped into three main types: centralized, decentralized, and hybrid team (also called semi-centralized, or “Hub-Spokes”) structures. Different team structures offer varying advantages and challenges:

1.  1\.

    **A centralized structure** involves placing all data science, machine learning, and AI product manager teams together under a single organizational unit. This structure fosters knowledge sharing, collaboration, and efficient allocation of resources. However, it can also lead to a lack of understanding of specific business units’ needs and may slow down decision-making. As we will see in the Scaling AI chapter, this is recommended for companies starting on the AI journey.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **A decentralized structure** distributes these teams across different business units, allowing them to work closely with domain experts and gain a better understanding of specific business requirements. However, this structure can lead to inefficiencies in resource allocation and potential duplication of efforts.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **A** **hybrid structure** combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized structures by maintaining a central AI center of excellence while embedding data scientists, machine learning experts, and AI product managers within individual business units. This approach ensures effective resource allocation, knowledge sharing, and alignment with specific business needs.

    &#x20;

Effective communication and collaboration is crucial to establish strong communication channels between technical and non-technical teams to ensure the success of AI initiatives. Encouraging regular meetings, sharing project updates, and providing training sessions can help bridge the gap between different team members. Moreover, using collaboration tools and platforms can facilitate information sharing, streamline project management, and improve overall team productivity.

Cross-functional teams that include data scientists, engineers, and AI product managers are essential for fostering innovation and driving business value. These teams allow for diverse perspectives and expertise to be brought together, leading to more effective problem-solving and decision-making. Furthermore, cross-functional teams can help ensure that AI projects are aligned with overall business objectives and address the specific needs of different stakeholders. Figure [14-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2) shows a comparison of the centralised vs distributed Team locations.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_14_Chapter/605840_1_En_14_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1049" width="945"><figcaption><p>Figure 14-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

The choice between these models depends on various factors, including the size of your organization, the scale of your AI initiatives, and your organization’s culture. We will explore further these options in Chapter [21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml).

**AI Centers of Excellence: Resources and Hybrid Structures**

While the best structure will vary depending on many aspects for each company, a structure which is highly recommended for companies in the lower and middle ladders of the maturity model is an AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE) and a hybrid version for more mature companies.

AI Centers of Excellence (CoE) play a vital role in driving the success of AI initiatives within organizations. In this subsection, we will discuss the purpose and benefits of AI CoE, provide guidance on centralizing resources, and explain how to set up hybrid structures that combine the best of centralized and decentralized approaches.

1.  1.**Purpose and benefits of AI Centers of Excellence**: AI CoE serves as a hub for knowledge sharing, skill development, and the promotion of best practices in AI implementation. By establishing a CoE, organizations can

    1.  a.

        Foster collaboration between data scientists, machine learning experts, and AI product managers.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Facilitate training and skill development to ensure that teams remain up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and methodologies.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Establish and maintain standardized processes, tools, and infrastructure, which can accelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Support the evaluation and selection of AI projects, ensuring alignment with business objectives and maximizing return on investment.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.**Centralizing resources for maximum effectiveness**: A key aspect of a successful AI CoE is the centralization of resources, including talent, tools, and infrastructure. By centralizing resources, organizations can

    1.  a.

        Ensure that AI projects have access to the necessary expertise and support, regardless of their location within the organization.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        For instance, an organization can have one Chief Science Officer shared across the key projects, rather than each business unit having their own one.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Streamline the procurement and management of AI tools and infrastructure, reducing costs and promoting consistency across projects.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Facilitate collaboration between teams and reduce duplication of efforts, leading to more efficient use of resources and faster delivery of AI solutions.

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        Recruitment: Talent attraction. In a highly competitive market as data science, a larger team with more career opportunities for the AI team is a competitive advantage attracting the top talent.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3.**Hybrid structures**: Combining centralized and decentralized approaches, hybrid structures can help organizations balance the need for centralized resources and support with the benefits of embedding AI expertise within individual business units. This is also specially recommended as an organization’s AI maturity level starts increasing, so by deployment of AI resources to the business units, the agility is improved. To set up a hybrid structure

    1.  a.

        Maintain a strong central AI CoE responsible for providing resources, training, and best practices.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Embed data scientists, machine learning experts, and AI product managers within individual business units, allowing them to work closely with domain experts and address specific business needs.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Establish clear communication channels between the central CoE and embedded teams, ensuring ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

In an article concerning organizational AI, Harvard Business Review[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5) presented an organizational blueprint for analytics personnel, centered around consolidated “hubs” and “spokes” embedded within each business sector. The “hub” (or in the language used above, the AI CoE) ensures a consistent approach to AI, overseeing tools, recruitment, overarching strategy, and infrastructure. The “spokes” bring accountability and sensitivity to the unique needs and capabilities of individual business units. The degree to which an analytics function is integrated will depend on each organization’s context, but I have seen the combined “hub and spokes” architecture to be notably effective.

The advantages of a hybrid structure are manifold for many organizations, especially in company or medium to large size. The hub (AI CoE) serves as a command center for organizational exploration, where decisions about common operational frameworks and infrastructure are made. The spokes, on the other hand, act as analytics advocates within product or business lines, adjusting the core strategy based on context. They instill accountability and business savvy. Moreover, the spokes function as the organization’s AI readiness indicators, staying attuned to when and where their specific business unit requires support. Bridging the gaps between the hubs and spokes are forward deployment engineers, who are prepared to undertake projects as needed.

AI Centers of Excellence (or Hubs in HBR terminology) play a crucial role in driving the success of AI initiatives. By establishing a CoE, centralizing resources, and adopting a hybrid structure, organizations can ensure that they have the necessary support and expertise in place to effectively implement AI solutions and drive business value.

#### Best Practices for Organizing Data Science and Machine Learning Teams

Best practices for organizing these teams include (see Table [14-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)).

* **Clear role definition**: Each team member should have a clear understanding of their role and responsibilities. This eliminates confusion and optimizes efficiency.
* **Efficient collaboration**: Promote regular communication and collaboration among team members. This can be done through regular meetings, collaborative tools, and team-building activities.
* **Continual learning**: Encourage team members to continually learn and update their skills. This could be through workshops, training sessions, or providing access to the latest research and publications.
* **Balancing research and applied work**: While it’s important for the team to keep up with the latest AI research, there should be a balance with applying that research to the company’s products or projects.

The AI product manager is a linchpin role, coordinating the work of the data science and machine learning teams. They ensure that the technical aspects align with business objectives. They also communicate the capabilities and limitations of AI models to stakeholders, manage the AI product roadmap, and prioritize features based on business needs and resources.Table 14-2&#x20;

Roles and best practices for organizing AI teams

| Role                      | Description                                                                                 | Best practices                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data scientist            | Create predictive models, develop machine learning algorithms, perform statistical analysis | Encourage continual learning, balance between research and applied work |
| Machine learning engineer | Code and deploy models into production environments                                         | Encourage continual learning, efficient collaboration                   |
| AI product manager        | Bridge between AI team and business, manage AI product roadmap                              | Clear role definition, efficient communication with stakeholders        |
| Data engineer             | Build and maintain data infrastructure                                                      | Encourage continual learning, efficient collaboration                   |

**Assembling High Performance Teams**

This is a very challenging task but one that will bring very high returns. The first point to notice is that there are plenty of books and “gurus” claiming to have the secret to do this. However, when you look at their methodology, most would focus looking only at the example of successful teams, analyze what they have/do, and then establish a causal relationship between what these successful teams have/do and how to be successful. The attentive reader would notice a few challenges in this approach from the data science point of view:

* **The “survival bias”** (remember the WWII plane from Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml)?): You need to include in your sample both successful and, more importantly, unsuccessful samples.
* **Confusing correlation with causation**: Just because two variables happen at the same time, it does not mean that one causes the other. While opening times for swimming pools and ice scream sales are highly correlated, if you start opening longer hours the pools in winter, it will not increase your ice scream sales (there is a hidden confounding variable, temperature, who is the one with the causal relationship). I explored causality in Chapters [8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_8\_Chapter.xhtml) and [9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml).
* Finally, a combination of the two above, failing to recognize that many factors are totally outside the team’s individual control, such as environment (upbringing, social connections, industry dynamics, etc.) and serendipity or luck.

Having made this point about “success frameworks,” I will list a few of factors that I have seen can make the difference between success and failure. Being involved in large scale new technology projects during my career, I have seen plenty of failure. Early in my career, most failures were due to immature technology, but in the last few years, the main issue is related to human factors, rather than technology. Therefore, I would be clear that following all these points will not guarantee necessary success; however, you would increase your success chances substantially:

1.  1.**Hire the best team for your problem**: It is important to understand here that the same team that will be great for a given problem in an organization with a certain culture could perform very badly in another. Here a few tips:

    1.  a.

        My personal recommendation is to hire attitude over skills.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Make sure you build a balanced team, from the personalities, skillset, and diverse points of view. Each role offers a unique perspective and skill set that contributes to the success of the project.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Look for relevant experience: While education and theoretical understanding are important, practical experience in developing and deploying AI models in a similar context is invaluable. Look for team members who have experience with the tools, platforms, and types of data you will be working with.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Be realistic based on your available budget, current industry talent pool and your specific organization objectives. If you try to follow the Amazon way to hire data scientists, the chances are it will not be right for you – even if you manage to throw enough budget to secure the talent.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Define clear goals and objectives – both internally to the team and the wider organization**: An important step in assembling a high-performance AI team is to define clear goals and objectives for the project and individual team members. These goals will guide your hiring decisions and help you identify the skills and expertise you need in your team. Set realistic expectations: AI projects can be complex and challenging, and they often involve some degree of uncertainty. Set realistic expectations and be prepared for setbacks or changes in direction.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Foster a collaborative and high-achieving environment**: High-performing AI teams often have a culture of collaboration and open communication. Foster this environment by encouraging team members to share ideas, ask questions, and work together to solve problems.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Use agile project management**: Agile project management methods can be particularly effective for managing AI projects. They allow for flexibility, continuous improvement, and frequent reassessment of project direction based on new insights or changes in the business environment. We will see in Chapter [15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml) how to use agile for AI teams.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Invest in the right tools and infrastructure**: Having the right tools and infrastructure in place can significantly improve the productivity and effectiveness of your AI team. This includes data storage and processing infrastructure, AI development platforms, and collaboration tools.

    &#x20;

**Size Matters**

How big your AI teams should be? Well, the attentive reader would guess the answer is “it depends.” The size of an AI team should be based on the needs of the company. A small team may be sufficient for a company that is just starting out with AI, while a larger team may be needed for a company that is already using AI in a significant way. As the company grows, the AI team may need to grow as well. This is because the company will have more data and more complex problems to solve. We will see more about this factor in Chapter [21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml).

There are a few factors to consider when deciding when to split teams or add middle management. One factor is the size of the team. If the team is too large, it may be difficult for everyone to communicate effectively. Another factor is the complexity of the work. If the work is very complex, it may be helpful to have a team leader who can help to coordinate the work and make decisions.

Communication is key to the success of any AI team. If team members are not able to communicate effectively, it will be difficult for them to work together and achieve their goals. The “pizza team size” is a rule of thumb that suggests that a team should be no larger than the number of people who can eat a pizza together. This is because it is easier for people to communicate and collaborate when they are in a smaller group.

Here are some signs that it may be time to split teams or add middle management:

* The team is too large.
* The work is too complex.
* Team members are not able to communicate effectively.

Having a well-organized AI team with clearly defined roles and a productive collaborative environment is crucial to the success of your AI initiatives. Up next, we will delve into creating an effective AI governance framework to guide your AI projects to success.

### AI Governance Framework

As AI continues to become integral to business operations, it has become increasingly evident that there’s a need for a comprehensive governance framework to guide AI initiatives. This governance not only ensures that AI projects align with business objectives but also guarantees compliance with ethical and legal standards.

Tip&#x20;

Exercise caution to avoid the adoption of general governance models, opting instead for a model distinctly tailored to your business and industry. To establish a robust AI governance framework, it’s vital to be precise in setting your overarching objectives. This involves clearly defining and reaching consensus on business goals, including risk appetite versus opportunity. For instance, compliance and legal considerations are indispensable, especially in regulated industries. Following that, priorities should be arranged according to each company’s specific needs, such as security, business agility, and so forth.

In this section, we will explore the critical components of an effective AI governance model, strategies for creating meaningful KPIs, and how to foster a culture that embraces AI.

An AI governance framework serves as a blueprint for managing and overseeing all AI activities within the organization. It is a multidimensional structure, covering areas like data governance, model governance, and ethical considerations. Figures [14-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) and [14-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) explained the recommended AI governance from the AIPP – this methodology was developed following a working group from industry, led by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority.[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn7)

Figure [14-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5) explained why it is so important to have the right governance. You can see on the left-hand side how many organizations are approaching AI at the model, in ad-hoc way with very mixed results and a high failure rate.

The first important part of AI governance is data. Many AI surveys have found that organizations with a well-defined data strategy have successfully established the primary foundations for an AI effective implementation. Think of data as the vital sustenance for your intelligent organization, and a well-rounded, nourishing meal as the ideal choice. Table [14-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3) outlines the elements that constitute an effective framework for AI governance.

**Data governance** encompasses an array of activities throughout the value chain; this involves delineating where and what data is collected within the organization, identifying its custodians, understanding its storage methods, and ensuring its accessibility via pipelines. Furthermore, guaranteeing _**high-quality data**_ – characterized by richness and structure – is equally as crucial as the data’s volume. This component of the framework pertains to the management and use of data. It covers data privacy, data quality, data integration, and data lifecycle management. These policies ensure that data used in AI models are not only legally compliant but also of high quality and reliable.

The second part of AI governance is **model governance**: model governance focuses on the lifecycle of AI models. This includes model development, validation, deployment, monitoring, and retirement. It ensures that models are robust, reliable, transparent, and that they can be trusted to make consistent, fair, and unbiased decisions.

Last, but not least, a growing important part of AI governance is **ethical guidelines**: AI should be used responsibly and ethically. This means that AI models should be fair, transparent, explainable, and they should respect privacy and human rights. A strong AI governance framework will contain guidelines to ensure that AI initiatives align with these principles.Table 14-3&#x20;

Components of an effective AI governance framework

| Component          | Description                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data governance    | Policies and procedures for managing and using data            |
| Model governance   | Oversight of the AI model lifecycle                            |
| Ethical guidelines | Principles to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically |

A very important part of governance is to have a way to measure how effective it is. Here, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are a vital tool for monitoring the performance and success of AI initiatives. They help measure the progress toward business goals, and they can be used to benchmark and compare performance over time or against competitors. However, creating effective KPIs for AI initiatives can be challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of AI. We discussed in Chapter [12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml) the best metrics for AI projects and operations.

It is also critical to cultivate a productive AI culture, a cornerstone of successful AI implementation. A positive AI culture can accelerate AI adoption, promote collaboration, enhance innovation, and boost morale among team members. Key strategies to build a productive AI culture include

* **Promoting collaboration**: Encourage team members to work together on AI projects. Collaboration can foster creativity, speed up problem-solving, and lead to more robust AI models.
* **Emphasizing transparency**: Be clear about what AI can and cannot do, how AI decisions are made, and the data used to train AI models. Transparency builds trust and helps manage expectations.
* **Encouraging ethical AI practices**: Make ethics a priority in all AI activities. This includes respecting privacy, being transparent, and promoting fairness and accountability.
* **Fostering continual learning**: AI is a rapidly evolving field. Encourage team members to stay up-to-date with the latest AI trends, tools, and best practices.
* **Accepting failure**: Not all AI projects will be successful. It’s essential to view failures as learning opportunities and not as reasons for discouragement.

A comprehensive AI governance framework is an essential tool for guiding your AI initiatives to success. By implementing effective data and model governance, aligning AI activities with ethical guidelines, establishing meaningful KPIs, and cultivating a productive AI culture, you will be well on your way to reaping the benefits of AI. In the next section, we will explore real-world case studies of successful AI organization and governance.

### Case Studies of Successful AI Organization and Governance

Examining real-world examples of successful AI organization and governance can provide us with invaluable insights. These case studies can offer lessons learned, best practices, and strategies to emulate. In this section, we will explore two companies that have excelled in implementing effective AI governance and organization – Google and IBM.

#### Google: AI-First Approach and Ethical AI Practices

Google has long been a leader in AI, adopting an AI-first approach to many of its products and services. This has demanded a thoughtful approach to organizing AI teams and creating effective governance frameworks.

Google’s AI teams are organized around their product areas such as Search, Ads, Cloud, and YouTube, allowing for close collaboration between the product, data science, and machine learning teams. This structure ensures that AI efforts are directly aligned with product goals and user needs. As well as AI team deployed to their business units, Google also had two main research teams, Deepmind and Brain Google. It is worth noting that both teams have been instrumental in the advancement of AI, and they should get a lot of credit as they have released to the wider community as Open Source both tools (e.g., Tensorflow) and also algorithms (e.g., Transformers, at the heart of the current generation of large language models such a ChatGPT). Nevertheless, Google in April 2023 merged their research teams,[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn8) creating Google DeepMind, out of DeepMind and the Brain team from Google Research.

In terms of governance, Google has developed an internal AI Principles Board[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn9), which reviews new projects, products, and deals to ensure they align with their published AI Principles. This includes considerations of fairness, transparency, privacy, and safety.

#### IBM: Centralized AI Team and Trusted AI Framework

IBM is another notable example of a company that has successfully organized and governed its AI initiatives. They have taken a centralized approach to AI, forming a specific business unit, IBM Watson, dedicated to developing and implementing AI technologies.

This centralized model provides multiple advantages, including fostering a culture of AI expertise and facilitating resource sharing. Moreover, it simplifies governance as there’s a single point of responsibility for AI initiatives.

IBM has also established a robust AI governance framework, known as “Trusted AI.” This framework focuses on three pillars – transparency, explainability, and fairness. It provides guidelines for the lifecycle of AI models, from data collection to model development, validation, and deployment. This includes a robust model review process and stringent data privacy and security measures.

Both Google and IBM demonstrate how an effective AI organization and governance strategy can lead to successful AI implementation. While they have adopted different team structures, they share common themes in their governance approaches, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and alignment with business and user needs.

These case studies highlight the importance of

* Having clear structures and roles for AI teams, tailored to your organization’s specific needs and objectives.
* Creating a robust AI governance framework, providing guidelines for data usage, model lifecycle, and ethical considerations.
* Fostering a culture that embraces AI, promoting collaboration, continual learning, and ethical AI practices.

As AI continues to evolve, so will the best practices for AI organization and governance. It’s essential for organizations to remain agile, continually reassessing and refining their strategies to ensure they are harnessing the power of AI effectively, ethically, and responsibly.
