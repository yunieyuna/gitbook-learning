# 15. Mastering AI Projects: Assemble, Lead, and Succeed

Welcome to this chapter on “Mastering AI Projects: Assemble, Lead, and Succeed.” Artificial intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for businesses across various sectors. However, tapping into this potential requires several crucial steps: from identifying the right AI use cases that align with your company’s objectives to assembling and leading a multidisciplinary AI team. These steps will form the bedrock of your AI strategy.

Identifying the right AI use cases starts with understanding your company’s objectives and potential areas for impact. Consider the tasks and processes in your organization that could be improved by automation or prediction, keeping a sharp focus on the data that you can realistically obtain and analyze. This brings us to the data monetization framework we discussed at length in Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml), which emphasizes value discovery. Value discovery seeks to uncover new revenue opportunities by leveraging data. This can range from improving operations and creating new customer experiences to transforming business models entirely.

Once we have identified suitable AI use cases, we need the right team to bring these to fruition. This team should ideally include an AI product manager to oversee project development and strategy, data scientists and machine learning engineers to build and deploy models, and IT infrastructure support to handle data storage and processing needs.

A key consideration in team formation is diversity – in skills, perspectives, and backgrounds. A multidisciplinary team can offer rich insights and foster innovative solutions. However, such teams often involve members from different organizational units. This diversity can be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to differences in objectives and rewards structures. Clear communication of team goals and alignment of incentives can help manage this challenge.

The role of leadership in such a team cannot be overstated. Leaders guide the team, make critical decisions, and promote a culture of learning and adaptability – an essential trait in the fast-paced world of AI. At times, especially in larger organizations or more complex projects, a chief scientist may be required. This role provides strategic leadership, oversees research and development, and fosters a culture of innovation.

Next, we delve into the realm of data science and machine learning teams. Establishing clear objectives, ensuring collaboration between data scientists and engineers, and learning from both success stories and projects that did not quite hit the mark are all vital for building effective teams.

Lastly, we explore how Agile principles can be applied to data science, a methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer centricity. Agile can be an effective approach for managing AI projects, which often involve complex and rapidly evolving requirements.

This chapter is designed to serve as a practical guide, offering you tangible methods, insights, and case studies to help navigate your AI journey. Let’s delve in.

### How to Identify AI Use Cases

Identifying effective AI use cases is one of the most crucial steps on your AI journey. The key is to identify opportunities that align with your company’s objectives and have a high potential for impact. You would need to use a framework to systematically address all the potential value your company has, I recommend the AI Data Framework we discussed in Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml), but others might also be suitable. The data monetization framework is an invaluable tool for identifying and prioritizing potential AI use cases. This framework directs you to focus on the discovery of value, which involves finding ways to generate profit or gain other business advantages from your available data. Identifying AI use cases begins with understanding your company’s objectives and pain points. By assessing these factors, you can pinpoint areas where AI can create value and improve your organization’s performance. To prioritize use cases, consider their potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with your company’s strategy. Studying success stories in your industry can provide valuable insights into the potential applications of AI.

Start by examining your company’s mission and vision statements, as well as its short-term and long-term strategic goals. Consider how AI can contribute to achieving these objectives. For example, if your company aims to improve customer satisfaction, AI-powered chatbots could help streamline customer service and provide quicker, more accurate responses.

Next, evaluate the pain points and inefficiencies within your organization. These could be areas where manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, or costly. AI can automate repetitive tasks, optimize complex processes, and facilitate better decision-making. Examples of AI use cases that address pain points include

* **Automating repetitive tasks** to free up employee time for higher-value work.
* **Enhancing customer experiences** with personalized product recommendations or chatbots.
* **Optimizing supply chain** and logistics operations through demand forecasting and route planning.
* **Identifying patterns in customer behavior** to improve marketing strategies.
* **Detecting fraud** or anomalies in financial transactions.

In terms of methodology, I also recommend the jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) methodology which complements very nicely with the AI data monetization framework from Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml). JTBD emphasizes understanding what core tasks your product or service is fulfilling for your customers. By identifying these tasks, you can find opportunities where AI can enhance your product or service. The methodology makes you go deeper, in a truly First Principles way, into why the consumer is utilizing your products, which in many cases it is a means to achieve another ultimate task (or “job”).

Another interesting way to uncover AI value in your enterprise is to study success stories from other organizations within your industry. This can provide valuable insights and inspiration for identifying AI use cases. By analyzing the AI applications that have delivered positive results for similar companies, you can better understand the potential of AI in your specific domain. When examining success stories, consider the following questions:

1.  1\.

    What problem did the AI solution address, and how was it solved?

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    How did the AI solution contribute to the organization’s success? This could include financial gains, improved customer satisfaction, or increased efficiency.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    What were the key challenges and lessons learned during the development and deployment of the AI solution?

    &#x20;

Finally, it’s crucial to focus on the data you realistically have. Data is the lifeblood of AI; without enough of the right kind of data, an AI initiative will struggle to get off the ground. A data audit, which assesses the quality, quantity, and accessibility of your data, is a necessary step in the process of identifying viable AI use cases.

Once you’ve identified your potential AI use cases, you should prioritize them based on their alignment with your business objectives, the expected impact, and your data availability (please refer to Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml), “Data Monetization,” for the full framework as to how to unlock value and then prioritize along the other strategic initiatives of the company). This will ensure that you are focusing your efforts on the use cases that are most likely to drive significant value for your business.

### Assembling a Multidisciplinary AI Team

Once you’ve identified AI use cases that align with your company’s objectives and have a high potential for impact, the next critical step is assembling a multidisciplinary AI team. This team will bring together the range of skills and expertise necessary to translate your identified AI use cases into successful AI implementations. In this subsection, we will explore the key resources needed for the AI project, strategies for fostering collaboration and shared success among team members from different organizations, and the importance of diverse skills and perspectives.

This is quite challenging, specifically in large enterprises, where business units will naturally aim for full control of all resources, but without a full grasp in all the techniques or reach to all critical resources. The resulting situation on many occasions is partially staffed teams without full ideal skillsets with various rates of success, and a silo approach where there is little or non-existent collaboration and synergies across different business units. This is highly counterproductive in an AI environment, where there is truly new value to discover when you join up datasets from different divisions. As we saw in earlier chapters, Comway’s law will heavily influence this setup, and solutions would mirror the human organization, which often is not the most optimal setup.

The first step in assembling your AI team is to identify the key roles needed, as outlined in Figure [15-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1). These roles often include an AI product manager, data scientists, machine learning (ML) engineers, and IT infrastructure support:

* The **AI product manager** is responsible for defining the vision of the AI product based on the company’s strategic objectives and identified use cases. They coordinate the efforts of the rest of the AI team and stakeholders to ensure that this vision is effectively realized. This role is critical, but you see in many organizations is not set. McKinsey, in their Harvard Business Review article[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1), called this role “**Analytics Translator**.”
* **Data scientists** are crucial for interpreting and analyzing data, creating predictive models, and ensuring the technical feasibility of AI initiatives.
* **Machine learning engineers** focus on building and deploying the models that data scientists create. They ensure that these models can operate effectively at scale.
* Finally, **IT infrastructure** is essential to provide the hardware and software resources necessary to develop, test, and deploy AI solutions.

However, the ideal composition of an AI team can depend on the specific AI use cases and the current capabilities of your organization. As such, it may also be necessary to include other roles, such as data engineers and business analysts.

In many cases, members of your AI team will come from different parts of your organization, or even from outside your organization entirely. This diversity can be a significant asset, bringing together a wide range of skills and perspectives. However, it can also present challenges, especially when it comes to ensuring alignment and collaboration.

To address this, it’s important to establish clear objectives for the AI project that align with the broader goals of all involved parties. _**This alignment should be reinforced by a reward system that recognizes both individual and team contributions**_ to the project’s success. Regular communication is also essential to maintain alignment and address any issues or misunderstandings that arise.

The _**importance of diverse skills and perspectives in an AI**_ team cannot be overstated. Diverse teams are more creative, make better decisions, and are better at problem-solving. This diversity isn’t just about professional skills – it also includes factors such as cultural background, gender, age, and more.

This diversity is particularly important in AI, a field that benefits from a combination of technical, business, and humanistic perspectives. Technical expertise is necessary to develop and implement AI solutions, but understanding the business context ensures that these solutions address relevant problems and deliver value. Humanistic perspectives are crucial for considering ethical implications and ensuring that AI solutions are designed and used responsibly.

A _**collaborative culture**_ is one of the most crucial components of a successful AI team. This collaboration is fostered through open and effective communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to share knowledge and resources. It involves everyone, from the AI product manager who sets the team’s direction to the data scientists and machine learning engineers who bring this vision to life.

To facilitate collaboration, it’s useful to establish clear protocols for communication and decision-making. These protocols should promote transparency and inclusivity, allowing all team members to contribute their ideas and concerns. Regular meetings, both for the entire team and for smaller groups working on specific aspects of the project, can also promote collaboration.

In the rapidly evolving field of AI, leadership and adaptability are crucial. Leaders guide the team, make crucial decisions, and ensure that the project stays aligned with its objectives. They also foster a culture that values innovation, learning, and adaptability. A key leadership role, a chief scientist can be a valuable addition to a data science team, providing strategic leadership, overseeing research and development, and fostering a culture of innovation. However, not every organization needs a chief scientist. Consider hiring a chief scientist if

* Your company is heavily invested in AI research and development.
* You require a strong technical leader to drive innovation and guide the team.
* The data science team is large and requires a high level of coordination and oversight.

_**Adaptability**_ is necessary because of the rapidly evolving nature of AI technology and the unpredictable challenges that can arise during an AI project. An adaptable team can learn from its mistakes, adjust its plans in response to new information or changes in the business environment, and continually improve its methods and outcomes.

_**Hybrid teams**_, which include members from different units or even different organizations, can be particularly effective for AI projects. They combine a diverse range of skills and perspectives, which can lead to more innovative and effective solutions. However, building and managing hybrid teams can be challenging. It involves integrating team members with different backgrounds, cultures, and expectations, and ensuring that they can work together effectively. Strategies for achieving this include clear communication, mutual respect, _**shared objectives and rewards**_, and opportunities for team members to learn about each other and build trust.

Building a multidisciplinary AI team is a complex but rewarding endeavor. It involves identifying key roles (Table [15-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)), fostering collaboration and shared success among diverse team members, and developing a culture that values diversity, collaboration, leadership, and adaptability. Please refer to Chapter [14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_14\_Chapter.xhtml) about how to set up a high performing team.Table 15-1&#x20;

Key roles and responsibilities in an AI team

| Role                      | Key responsibilities                                                                          |

| Data scientist            | Interpret and analyze data, create predictive models                                          |
| Machine learning engineer | Build and deploy scalable ML models                                                           |
| IT infrastructure         | Provide necessary hardware and software resources for AI development, testing, and deployment |

#### Future Evolution of AI Teams

The relentless march of technology has driven transformative changes across industries. The realm of data science has been no exception. It emerged a mere decade ago, following DJ Patil’s coining of the term “data science” in 2008[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2), and swiftly burgeoned into an integral part of modern businesses. This was marked by the constitution of data teams, replete with data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers. Each of these roles had unique responsibilities within the data pipeline.

However, the evolution of generative AI and no-code technology, coupled with the increasing demand for maximizing ROI per data scientist, is causing a paradigm shift in this structure. The future sees the advent of the _**full-pipe (or full-stack) data scientist**_, a role that integrates the functions of the pipeline and enhances overall efficiency.

**The Duality ML Engineer vs Data Scientist**

Traditional data science roles are segregated. Data engineers constructed the data pipeline, data scientists conducted statistical analyses and constructed models, and ML engineers ensured scalable model deployment. Yet, this division of labor has proved expensive, with critical drawbacks manifesting in practice.

Data scientists, often having an abundance of theoretical knowledge, found themselves lacking in practical proficiency. They may understand algorithms in-depth but struggle with writing a simple API for model service. They may construct an effective model for an offline dataset in Jupyter Notebook but fail to consider how it needs to function online, in terms of online metrics, latency, and throughput. Code published by data scientists may require extensive re-writing by ML engineers and software engineers, to eliminate inefficiencies.

The outcomes of these issues can be severe. Even at tech giants, model development has been hampered by these shortcomings, resulting in wasted time and resources, and, at times, embarrassment.

**The Future: Full-Pipe Data Scientists**

Advances in generative AI and no-code technology will likely reshape traditional data science teams, catalyzing the emergence of full-stack data scientists. These individuals will handle the entire data pipeline, leveraging AI to automate parts of the process and no-code solutions to develop models, improving efficiency and ROI. The new paradigm demands broader skill sets and necessitates adaptive training. Despite challenges, this evolution, propelled by technology, offers promising returns and calls for readiness to adapt to novel tools and methods.

### Agile in Data Science

Adopting Agile methodologies in data science projects is not just a trend, but rather a necessity given the dynamic nature of AI development. Agile principles can help data science teams adapt to changes, maintain flexibility, and continually learn from project development. To understand the implementation of Agile in data science, we must first grasp the core principles of Agile and how they align with data science objectives. It is indeed very important to go deep into the First Principles of Agile, and adapt them to the data science process, rather than focusing on a specific implementation of Agile and forcing it.

The Agile methodology is based on iterative and incremental development. It was first introduced through the Agile Manifesto in 2001,[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3) intended to streamline software development. The principles include prioritizing customer satisfaction through continuous delivery, accommodating changing requirements, frequent delivery of smaller portions of working software, and regular adaptation to changing circumstances.

In the context of data science, these principles are highly relevant. Data science projects often need to adapt quickly to new data, evolving business needs, and technological advancements.

Applying Agile principles to data science projects can offer several benefits. Figure [15-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2) show the end to end Data science process in an Agile approach. For instance, Agile encourages regular communication and feedback, enabling a better understanding of the business context. This way, data scientists can align their work more closely with the company’s strategic goals.

Moreover, in Agile, the concept of delivering working software in smaller, manageable increments suits the exploratory nature of data science. Data scientists can focus on delivering actionable insights and models iteratively, and then improve them over time based on feedback and new data.

Finally, Agile’s emphasis on responding to change aligns with the often-unpredictable nature of data science, where initial hypotheses might be refuted by data, requiring a change in direction.

While Agile can benefit data science teams, the unique challenges of AI projects require some adaptations to traditional Agile practices.

For instance, unlike software development, where progress can be measured by completed features, data science outcomes are uncertain until the data has been explored. Agile in data science, therefore, emphasizes working on small but complete slices of analytics problems, delivering models that can be tested and improved incrementally, and many **high uncertain tasks in a time-boxed approach**.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_15_Chapter/605840_1_En_15_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="775" width="1714"><figcaption><p>Figure 15-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

Moreover, cross-functional collaboration is vital, requiring clear communication channels between data scientists, data engineers, business stakeholders, and others. Agile practices such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives can be useful in this context, ensuring alignment and facilitating problem-solving.

Finally, data science projects might require extra attention to data management, infrastructure, and version control, which should be incorporated into Agile practices.

AI projects present additional challenges. For instance, building machine learning models often involves a significant amount of experimentation, and the “right” solution might not be clear until late in the process. The Agile principle of “failing fast” can be beneficial here, enabling teams to quickly test hypotheses and learn from failures. Table [15-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_15\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2) shows a comparison of traditional vs Agiles methodologies when applied to the Data Science process.

Moreover, AI solutions often require substantial computational resources and specialized hardware, which need to be planned for and managed as part of the project. It’s also important to consider ethical issues and potential biases in AI, and include these considerations in the Agile process.

Agile in data science can help teams adapt to change, deliver value incrementally, and align closely with business objectives. While the unique challenges of data science and AI require some adaptations to traditional Agile practices, the principles of Agile remain highly relevant and beneficial.Table 15-2&#x20;

Comparison of traditional and Agile methodologies in data science

| Aspect        | Traditional data science | Agile data science                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Process       | Linear, waterfall        | Iterative, incremental, time-boxed uncertain tasks |
| Adaptability  | Changes are disruptive   | Changes are expected, welcomed                     |
| Communication | Periodic                 | Frequent, regular                                  |
