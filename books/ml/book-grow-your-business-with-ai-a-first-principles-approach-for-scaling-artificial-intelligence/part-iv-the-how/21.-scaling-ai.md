# 21. Scaling AI

This is the last chapter of Part IV, “The HOW,” where we put everything together to provide guidance as to how to truly scale AI in any enterprise. We have explored “Thy WHY” most, if not all, companies should be embarking on an urgent AI Transformation. We have also gone deep into the intuition and First Principles of “The WHAT” of AI, so the reader should be able to evaluate different algorithms for different situations. We are now in the final chapter on “The HOW,” how to bring to live all these capabilities, and in this last chapter, we will explore how to consistently deploy AI at scale across all types of organizations in different industries and sizes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the business landscape, enabling companies to automate tasks, make data-driven decisions, and create new products and services. However, despite the potential benefits, we have seen why many companies struggle to implement AI at scale. Implementing AI requires a significant investment of resources, including technology, talent, and time. It also requires a thorough understanding of the business needs, the technology, and the processes involved. Last but not least, the importance of governance cannot be overstated, and its significance grows proportionally with the size of an organization.

### Core Components of Scaling AI

To overcome these challenges, companies must address the five pillars of AI scaling, which are the core components from a First Principles perspective:

* Company AI cross adoption
* Governance and responsible AI
* Skills and diversity
* AI technology and infrastructure
* AI R\&D

#### Despite the Potential, Most Companies Struggle to Deploy AI at Scale

AI is already delivering high ROI to a few large tech companies. The overall AI usage is also increasing year by year. But not all companies manage to extract the same value.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="821" width="1719"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

In the preceding graph (Figure [21-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)) from McKinsey and Bank of England AI/ML survey, it is very clear that while some companies are indeed benefiting greatly, most struggle.

#### Why Is AI Implementation so Difficult?

Many companies struggle to implement AI because they lack a clear understanding of the business requirements and the technology involved. They also struggle to align their AI strategy with their overall business strategy, which results in disjointed efforts and suboptimal outcomes. Additionally, many companies are unable to attract and retain the necessary talent to implement and manage AI initiatives. The shortage of data scientists and AI experts has resulted in high salaries and intense competition for these resources. Moreover, companies often struggle to establish effective governance and responsible AI practices, which are critical to ensuring that AI initiatives are aligned with their values and ethical principles.

When you analyze deeply the challenges, as discussed widely in Chapter [4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml), most come from a core issue which is commonly overlooked; the “Elephant in the room” is the fact there are two groups of people, “business-minded” and “technical-Scientist” which effectively talk different languages and more importantly have different goals and motivation. Therefore, the role of a translator between the groups is extremely important, and when they are aligned the outcomes can indeed be incredible! The reality is that organizations, especially large ones, have legacy management structures which default in siloed behavior. This well-known issue is a massive barrier for any change to the organization, but especially AI as requires truly collaboration from many parts of the organization.

#### What AI Excellence Looks Like: What Large Tech Companies Do Differently for AI

Large tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple have set the standard for AI excellence. These companies have made significant investments in AI, many from their inception, and they have established a culture of innovation companywide that enables them to effectively implement and scale AI initiatives. They have also put in place robust governance and responsible AI practices, which ensure that AI is aligned with their values and ethical principles. Additionally, these companies have invested heavily in R\&D, which allows them to develop new AI technologies and techniques and effectively be market leaders. In summary, these are the key areas that leading AI companies have:

* **AI-first mindset**: AI is not an afterthought, but something at the core of each company. For instance, all projects must consider AI from the get-go (although not all will use it) Amazon, Microsoft, etc. Right mixed teams, all separated R\&D part, and deployed DS team within business units.
* **Scale AI infrastructure and engineering**: All have end-to-end proprietary tech stacks to facilitate AI. Some release the software stacks to the open community (Meta, Google, Microsoft).
* **Data centric**: All companies have data first strategies.
* **Focus on use cases**: Establishing baselines and having clear and constant business value-driven strategies.
* **Rapid interaction**: AI is quite different to standard software – you need to iterate/operate in a continuous way.

#### AI Maturity Level

Not all companies can imitate overnight the success of large AI tech ones. Where is your company in this process?

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="808" width="1416"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

This chapter will show you how to climb the maturity ladder (Figure [21-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)), which is by creating a very specific targeted plan to your company that addresses all five pillars, each in a different way depending on your starting point in the maturity AI model and your desired target.

#### AI Maturity: How to Get to the Top Faster

I analyzed dozens of strategic AI roadmaps from top economies (the USA[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5), China[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn6), the UK[7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn7), Canada[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn8) up to 32 countries have an AI strategy so far) and large private tech AI organizations so you do not have to do it.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="813" width="1713"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

To implement AI at scale, you will need to address the pillars presented in Figure [21-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3). And a key step to achieve AI excellence is for companies to align their AI strategy with their overall business strategy and establish a culture of innovation. They must also establish effective governance and responsible AI practices, invest in R\&D, and build the necessary skills and infrastructure to support AI initiatives. Companies must also focus on data and AI metrics, which are critical to measuring the impact of AI initiatives and determining whether they are delivering value.

#### Why Hardly Any Companies Included AI in Digital Transformation

Despite many companies undergoing digital transformation in recent years, very few have included AI as part of their transformation. This is due, in part, to a lack of understanding of the technology and the potential benefits. It is also due to a lack of investment in AI talent and infrastructure. Additionally, many companies struggle to align their AI strategy with their overall business strategy, which results in disjointed efforts and suboptimal outcomes. Finally, many companies lack the governance and responsible AI practices necessary to ensure that AI is aligned with their values and ethical. In summary, most of these transformations focus on doing a “lift and shift” moving apps from mainframes to the Cloud, but effectively the same business rules.

Tip&#x20;

If your organization is either starting or in the middle of a digital transformation, challenge the “lift and shift” approach. Moving the same business rules from one platform to another will not fundamentally grow your business. However, whenever appropriated, transforming legacy rigid rules into AI-driven flexible applications can really catapult your business growth!

### Pillar 1: Company AI Cross Adoption

In this section, we will focus on the first pillar, company-wide AI adoption, which is a critical step to ensure the whole organization benefits from AI whenever appropriated. The right use cases for AI must be uncovered. Not all projects will benefit, and some might not appear on the standard channels. You will need to make a few difficult decisions, depending on maturity and strategy.

There are two key areas to maximize companywide AI adoption:

1.  1.**Fully aligning the business strategy with the AI strategy**: As discussed at length in Chapters [11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_11\_Chapter.xhtml) and [12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml), to ensure that AI technology is effectively used across the enterprise, it is critical to align AI capabilities, both present and future, with the overall business strategy. This requires a clear understanding of the company’s business goals and objectives, as well as the ways in which AI can contribute to these goals. It is important to engage key stakeholders from across the organization in this process, including business leaders, data scientists, and IT teams, to ensure that all perspectives are considered. This can be achieved through several steps, including

    1.  a.

        **Defining clear goals and objectives**: The first step is to define clear goals and objectives, using business outcome language, not technical. This includes identifying the specific business problems that AI can solve, as well as the potential revenue streams that can be generated from the deployment of AI.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        **Developing an AI roadmap**: Once clear goals and objectives have been defined, companies should develop an AI roadmap that outlines the steps that need to be taken to deploy AI solutions. This roadmap should include timelines, budgets, and resources, as well as a clear plan for integrating AI into each department’s operations.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        **Engaging stakeholders**: To ensure company-wide AI adoption, it is important to engage all stakeholders, including senior leaders, employees, and customers. This includes involving them in the development of the AI roadmap and ensuring that they are aware of the benefits of AI and how it will impact their work.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        **Establish a governance framework** to ensure that AI is being used in a responsible and ethical manner.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.**Focusing on business outcome baselines**: To ensure that AI technology is being used effectively and delivering value, it’s important to focus on baselines and AI metrics. AI metrics are key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives and key results (OKRs) that help organizations to measure the impact of AI on the business. The goal is not necessarily to achieve perfect AI at all costs – being this a common mistake – but rather to demonstrate that AI can provide a better result than current business processes:

    1.  a.

        Defining key metrics: The first step in focusing on baselines, AI metrics is to define key metrics that will be used to measure the success of AI solutions. This includes identifying the specific business problems that AI can solve, as well as the potential revenue streams that can be generated from the deployment of AI.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Measuring and reporting results: Companies must measure and report on the results of the AI solutions deployed by each department. This includes tracking the benefits of AI, such as increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, and reduced costs. This data can be used to demonstrate the value of AI to the organization, and to encourage other departments to consider and deploy AI solutions. It is also very important to keep using these metrics over time, as per the following point.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Continuously improving: Companies must continuously improve their AI solutions by using data and metrics to identify areas for improvement. This includes using AI metrics to measure the effectiveness of AI solutions and using the results to make continuous improvements.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

Tip&#x20;

The larger the organization, the more important the governance became. Most organizations have legacy management structures which create unintended siloed behaviors – a bit of “Moloch” effect as we saw in the Introduction. You need to be fully aware of this underlying issue, so your project has the right support from senior management, but more importantly, there are the right metrics and cross-teams incentives to be successful. Just having top management is not enough.

Here are five sample KPIs and OKRs that can be used to measure the impact of AI on the business (please refer to Chapter [12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_12\_Chapter.xhtml) for a more extended coverage):

* **Improved customer satisfaction**: KPIs could include the number of customer complaints, the time it takes to resolve customer issues, and customer feedback scores. OKRs could be set to reduce customer complaints by X% over Y months.
* **Increased sales**: KPIs could include the number of new customers, the average order value, and the conversion rate. OKRs could be set to increase sales by X% over Y months.
* **Improved efficiency**: KPIs could include the time it takes to process an order, the number of errors in an order, and the number of manual interventions required. OKRs could be set to reduce manual interventions by X% over Y months.
* **Reduced costs**: KPIs could include the cost of goods sold, the cost of processing an order, and the cost of customer service. OKRs could be set to reduce the cost of processing an order by X% over Y months.
* **Improved employee engagement**: KPIs could include employee turnover, the number of hours worked, and employee feedback scores. OKRs could be set to increase employee engagement by X% over Y months.

While these are good examples of KPIs and OKRs for AI, it is important to avoid using KPIs and OKRs that are not directly related to the business goals. For example, using the accuracy of an AI model as a KPI is not as relevant as using the impact of the model on business outcomes, such as improved customer satisfaction or reduced costs.

Company AI cross-adoption is an important aspect of successfully scaling AI in the enterprise. By fully aligning the business strategy with the AI strategy and focusing on baselines and AI metrics, companies can ensure that AI is being used effectively to deliver real business value. This will ultimately lead to a company-wide commitment to AI, and a more successful scaling of AI in the enterprise.

### Pillar 2: Governance and Responsible AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the business landscape, but with this transformation comes a need for proper governance and ethical considerations. The implementation of AI must be done in a responsible and ethical manner to ensure that it benefits both the company and society as a whole. As AI continues to play a larger role in the enterprise, companies must address the critical importance of governance and responsible AI adoption.

#### Who Is Responsible for Ensuring AI Is Done in the Right Way?

AI is a cross-functional and complex technology that requires the collaboration of various departments such as technology, legal, ethics, and human resources. It is crucial to establish clear ownership and accountability for AI governance within the organization. A dedicated AI governance team or a designated senior executive should be responsible for overseeing the implementation of AI and ensuring it aligns with the company’s values and ethical principles.

While there is not a “silver-bullet” answer which fit to all companies, using first principals we need to ensure that (1) there is accountability/ownership and (2) all the right areas are implemented in the best pragmatic way to each unique organization context: culture, current organization, market position, and size. I strongly recommend the BoE/FCA industry guide advisory document about how to successfully implement and scale artificial intelligence within Financial Services. I had the privilege to be part of the expert industry group who contributed to the guidelines,[9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn9) so I know it has considered all different perspectives from different stakeholders within the industry, which can be extended to most industries. Figures [21-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4) and [21-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5) explain the high level concept needed to implement AI in a responsible way.

Regardless of how you organize your AI teams, AI governance is best done centrally. Need to have a focus on explainable and responsible models.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="998" width="1714"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1358" width="1122"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Where to Put AI Organizations

No single silver bullet depends on many factors. Figure [21-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6) shows the pros and cons of a centralized vs a distributed way. In many cases, the same company will change structures as they climb positions in the AI maturity models. When companies are small, it makes sense to have a central team but with clear alignment with the other teams. As the company – and AI project success – grows, at some point it might make sense to move the resources to the business units. This is what Meta did in a re-organization in 2022,[10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn10) and despite still having pure R\&D centralized, they moved the Applied Data Science teams to the business units to be more flexible, agile, and accelerate AI deployment across all business units.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1114" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-6 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Responsible AI: Ethics

The implementation of AI must be done in a manner that respects ethical principles and values. Companies must consider the potential consequences of their AI systems and ensure that they do not violate privacy rights, perpetuate biases, or harm individuals. AI systems must also be transparent and explainable, so users can understand how they make decisions. Companies can incorporate ethical considerations into the development process by conducting impact assessments, involving experts in ethics and human rights, and incorporating feedback from stakeholders. We expand this topic in Chapter [20](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_20\_Chapter.xhtml).

#### Company Culture

This is probably one of the most underestimated factors. In AI governance, there is not a single answer that will fit all companies, and as well as maturity level, company size, and industry (whether regulated or not), many other factors will come into play when deciding the AI organization model.

The decision to centralize or decentralize AI resources should be based on the specific needs and culture of the organization. Company culture can have a significant impact on how AI teams are organized and managed. For example, in a hierarchical organization with a strong top-down management style, centralization may be more effective, as it provides clear lines of control and authority. In contrast, in a more decentralized, collaborative organization, decentralization may be more appropriate, as it fosters greater ownership and accountability among business units. Another consideration, in regulated industries such as financial services where most organizations implement the three lines of defense organization structure, a more centralized approach but with common business goals with the business lines provides the best organization structure.

#### Team Size

The size of an AI team can vary greatly depending on the specific needs and goals of a company. At its core, an AI team typically consists of data scientists, machine learning engineers, data engineers, and sometimes, AI research scientists. However, as an organization scales, other roles such as project managers, product managers, data analysts, data labeling specialists, or AI ethicists can become important.

When it comes to deciding the team size, communication plays a crucial role. According to the principle known as **Brooks’ Law**[11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn11), “Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.” The reasoning is that as the number of people in a team increases, the amount of communication needed to coordinate their efforts increases exponentially.

**Amazon’s “Two Pizza Rule”**[12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn12), which posits that teams should be small enough to be fed with two pizzas, further underlines the importance of keeping teams small for efficient communication and productivity. This usually translates to somewhere _**between 5 and 7 individuals**_, depending on appetites.

As your company grows and your projects multiply, you’ll likely need to expand your team. If communication within the team starts becoming a major hurdle or if individuals start to wear too many hats, these are indications that the team may need to be split or increased in size.

While splitting a team, it’s essential to ensure each team has a clear, defined purpose. Amazon’s practice of establishing “single-threaded” teams, or teams that focus on one particular area, can be a good approach here. Each team needs to have enough skills to achieve its objectives and to operate with a high degree of autonomy.

Adding middle management usually becomes necessary when the number of teams starts to grow, and senior management can no longer efficiently handle direct communication with all individual teams or team members. Middle managers can help by taking over some of the communication, coordination, and decision-making tasks. They can also serve as vital communication bridges between the technical team members and the higher management, who might not be as deeply involved in the technical aspects of projects.

In the end, the right size for your AI team will depend on your company’s specific circumstances. A small, well-functioning team can accomplish a lot when they have clear communication and a shared understanding of their goals. As the team grows, maintaining these principles becomes more challenging but also more important. Always remember that it’s not just about having more people on the team, but how these individuals collaborate and drive the project towards its objectives.

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

When implementing AI, it is important to avoid common pitfalls that can undermine governance and ethics. One common pitfall is the lack of transparency in AI systems, which can lead to a lack of accountability and trust. Another pitfall is the perpetuation of biases in AI systems, which can result in discriminatory outcomes. It is also crucial to avoid the over-reliance on AI systems, which can lead to the loss of human expertise and judgment. Companies must strike a balance between the benefits of AI and the need to respect ethical principles and values.

In conclusion, governance and responsible AI adoption are critical components of successfully scaling AI in the enterprise. Companies must establish clear ownership and accountability for AI governance and prioritize ethical considerations in the development and implementation of AI systems. By avoiding common pitfalls and incorporating best practices, companies can ensure that their AI systems are transparent, accountable, and respectful of ethical principles and values.

### Pillar 3: Skills and Diversity

Scaling AI in the enterprise requires addressing several critical pillars, including skills and diversity. Ensuring the right mix of skills and promoting diversity in your organization can help drive AI adoption and support the successful implementation of AI projects.

1.  1\.

    **Ensure you have the right mixed team**: Having a team with a mix of expertise in data science, machine learning engineering, and AI product management is essential for successful AI implementation. Data scientists are responsible for analyzing data, selecting the right algorithms, and testing models to ensure accuracy. Machine learning engineers are responsible for implementing and deploying AI models. AI product managers are responsible for overseeing the entire AI project lifecycle, ensuring that it aligns with the company’s goals and objectives.

    When building your AI team, it is essential to consider diversity in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and other personal characteristics. A diverse team can bring new perspectives, fresh ideas, and different ways of thinking to the table, leading to more innovative and impactful AI solutions. Additionally, a diverse team can also better understand and serve the needs of diverse customer segments.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Educate** _**everyone**_ **in your organization**: While it is important to have the right mix of AI skills on your team, it is also crucial that everyone in your organization has a basic understanding of AI. This can help to ensure that AI is integrated into the company’s overall strategy and that everyone can contribute to its success.

    &#x20;

To achieve this, companies can offer AI training programs for all employees, regardless of their role or level within the organization. These programs can help to increase AI literacy and understanding, which can lead to more effective collaboration and problem-solving. Additionally, providing AI training can help to promote a culture of innovation, where employees are encouraged to embrace and leverage AI to drive business growth.

The following are best practices when it comes to have the right skillsets and diversity:

* **Foster a culture of continuous learning**: Encourage your team to stay up to date with the latest AI advancements and technologies by providing ongoing training and development opportunities.
* **Hire for potential and train for skills**: When hiring for AI roles, focus on the candidate’s potential, not just their current skill set. With the right training and development, new hires can quickly become valuable contributors to your AI team.
* **Encourage cross-functional collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between your AI team and other departments, such as marketing, sales, and customer support. This can help to ensure that AI is integrated into the company’s overall strategy and that everyone can contribute to its success.

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Ensuring the right mix of skills and promoting diversity in your organization are critical components of successfully scaling AI in the enterprise. Below are some potential pitfalls to avoid:

* **Hiring solely based on technical skills**: While technical skills are important, they should not be the only factor considered when building your AI team. Soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, are equally important and should also be considered when making hiring decisions.
* **Ignoring diversity**: Failing to promote diversity in your AI team can lead to a lack of diversity in thought and ideas, which can limit innovation and impact.
* **Neglecting employee education**: Failing to provide AI training to all employees can lead to a lack of understanding and a lack of adoption. This can also lead to a culture of fear and resistance toward AI, making it more difficult to integrate AI into your business strategy.

You will need to have the right team composition to execute the different AI data-driven projects and the right level of AI understanding across the organization. Having all the knowledge in one team can be inefficient. The following Figure [21-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7) shows an ideal data science/AI team. Please note how it is very important to have all these four roles. Many organizations fail to include one or two, which can lead to project failure. While all teams will include data scientists, many organizations do not include anyone from the IT team. This will make the roll-out to production very complicated. Another mistake, it is not to include a “Business/Product Translator,” which can create long delays, as scientists will by default try to do every model as performance as possible, but in many cases, as long as the new AI model is better than the baseline, it is always better to release quickly a minimum quality and then improve over time with actual data, rather than spending months and months on the “perfect” model with limited historical data.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="889" width="1063"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-7 </p></figcaption></figure>

### Pillar 4: AI Infrastructure

When it comes to scaling AI in the enterprise, one of the most important aspects is having the right infrastructure in place. Without an effective AI infrastructure, it will be challenging to deploy and operate AI systems at scale, especially as your organization’s AI footprint grows.

Figure [21-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8) shows the three main components that any AI solution will need: AI needs data, most of your data will be in your legacy systems – hence the API’s, and the best place to build in a future proven approach your solution is to use cloud infrastructure:

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484296691/files/images/605840_1_En_21_Chapter/605840_1_En_21_Fig8_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="955" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 21-8 </p></figcaption></figure>

As we explain in Chapter [16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_16\_Chapter.xhtml), there are two main approaches to building an AI infrastructure: buying vs building. Depending on your organization’s maturity level and the specific needs of your AI projects, you may opt for one approach over the other. For organizations that are just starting out with AI, buying pre-built infrastructure may be a more efficient and cost-effective solution. On the other hand, for organizations that have a mature AI program and a deep understanding of their specific requirements, building a custom infrastructure from the ground up may be a more suitable option. Hybrid approaches can also work for some organizations; they can provide some basic functionality using the market tools and customize specific functionality to their needs.

Open-source tools are becoming increasingly popular for organizations looking to build their AI infrastructure. These tools offer the flexibility and cost-effectiveness that organizations need to get started quickly, while also providing the ability to customize the infrastructure to meet their specific requirements. Some popular open-source tools for machine learning operations (MLOps) include Kubeflow, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

As your organization’s AI footprint grows, it is important to have a cross-business unit (BU) capability to manage the deployment and operation of AI systems. This involves having a centralized team that is responsible for overseeing the entire AI infrastructure, while also ensuring that the infrastructure is aligned with the overall business strategy. The centralized team should also work closely with other BUs to ensure that AI systems are deployed and operated in a consistent and scalable manner.

One of the biggest challenges when it comes to scaling AI in the enterprise is the need for data. AI systems require large amounts of data to train models and make accurate predictions. Most of this data is likely to be stored in legacy systems, which can make it difficult to access and use in AI systems. To overcome this challenge, organizations need to have a cloud-based infrastructure that provides access to the data, as well as APIs that can be used to interface with legacy systems.

When it comes to best practices for building/buying an AI infrastructure, it is important to focus on the following:

* **Start small and build incrementally**: When starting out with AI, it is important to build an infrastructure that can scale as your organization grows. This means starting with a small set of tools and systems and adding more as needed.
* **Focus on ease of use and scalability**: Your AI infrastructure should be easy to use and scalable, so that it can support the deployment and operation of AI systems at scale.
* **Invest in MLOps**: MLOps is a critical component of AI infrastructure, so it’s important to invest in the tools and processes that are needed to manage the deployment and operation of AI systems. Also, your MLOps must be integrated with the rest of your system management operation, for instance, when an L1 alert is generated, this needs to be routed real-time to the right team looking at the right monitoring console.
* **Ensure data security and privacy**: Your AI infrastructure should have robust security and privacy controls in place to protect sensitive data and ensure that data is used in a responsible manner. This is especially important in multi-cloud environments.
* **Avoid silos**: Your AI infrastructure should be designed to promote collaboration and cross-BU capabilities, so that data and AI systems can be shared and reused effectively.

There are many cloud providers, AWS. Azure, Google, IBM, Oracle, and many other cloud providers have similar capabilities. Pick the right one for your organization, and large organizations might have multiple cloud providers. Figure [21-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig9) shows a sample cloud architecture with some key components. The cloud industry is moving at a very high pace, and new services and components are continuously released by major vendors which will accelerate application development. As an example where AWS launched, it had just a few services, and now have over 200 and growing.

Building an effective AI infrastructure is a key factor in scaling AI in the enterprise. Whether you opt for a buy or build approach, it is important to focus on ease of use, scalability, data security, and privacy. With the right infrastructure in place, your organization will be well-positioned to achieve the benefits of AI at scale.

### Pillar 5: AI R\&D

AI R\&D is an important component of scaling AI in the enterprise. However, it is not recommended for companies that are just starting to adopt AI. At the same time, for the most mature AI companies, a dedicated AI R\&D team can provide a huge competitive advantage. This is because AI is still in the early stages of development, and companies that invest in AI R\&D are likely to be ahead of their competition.

To take advantage of AI R\&D, it is recommended to have a central team focused on researching AI. This team can focus on areas specific to the company’s industry and investigate AI standards. By having a dedicated AI R\&D team, the company can ensure that it is keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and that it is prepared to implement new technologies as they become available.

One best practice in AI R\&D is to focus on solving specific problems facing the industry. For example, if the company is in the healthcare industry, the AI R\&D team can focus on developing AI solutions that help with patient diagnosis or improve the efficiency of medical procedures. This way, the company can ensure that its AI R\&D efforts are directly contributing to the company’s bottom line.

Another best practice is to collaborate with universities, research institutions, and other companies to share knowledge and ideas. By working with others, the company can learn from their experiences, and gain access to new technologies and techniques that it may not have been able to develop on its own. Many countries have government-backed organizations which an objective to implement their particular national AI roadmap. In the UK, the Alan Turing (AT) institute[13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn13) is tasked with fulfilling part of this R\&D mandate of the UK’s national AI roadmap[14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_21\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn14). It is also interesting to point out that the AT institute collaborates with top UK universities and industry to carry out applied research. Should your company be based in the UK or have a presence there, it is a very interesting route to explore. In any case, many other large countries will have similar schemes.

There are also common pitfalls to avoid when setting up an AI R\&D team. One of the biggest is not having enough resources. AI R\&D is a complex and resource-intensive process, and companies need to invest in it if they want to see results. Another pitfall is not having the right team. Companies need to ensure that their AI R\&D team has the right mix of expertise, including data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI product managers.

AI R\&D is a critical component of scaling AI in the enterprise, and companies that invest in it are likely to be ahead of their competition. Companies should focus on solving specific problems, collaborating with others, and avoid common pitfalls such as not having enough resources or the right team. By doing so, they can ensure that their AI R\&D efforts are contributing to the company’s bottom line.

### Putting All Together: Designing Your Company-Specific AI Roadmap

Now that we have discussed the five pillars that companies must address to successfully scale AI in their enterprise, it is time to put them all together and design a specific AI roadmap for your company. It is important to note that each company’s roadmap will be unique and tailored to their specific needs based on their current AI maturity level, their target AI maturity level, and the investment required to cover the gap.

#### Assessing Your Company’s AI Maturity Level

The first step in designing your AI roadmap is to assess your company’s current AI maturity level. This assessment will help you determine where your company stands in terms of AI adoption and identify the gaps that need to be addressed to achieve your desired AI maturity level.

There are several AI maturity models available, including the AI Maturity Model by Cognizant, the AI Maturity Framework by IBM, the Microsoft AI maturity model, and the AI Readiness Assessment by Gartner. These models typically consist of several levels, ranging from basic AI adoption to advanced AI capabilities. By assessing your company’s current AI capabilities, you can determine where you stand on the AI maturity model scale and identify the gaps that need to be addressed.

While it is not important which maturity model you select, it is important to do the exercise in a transparent way with the right governance and team skillset appropriate for your company size and culture. This will be heavily impacted by the culture of the company.

Tip&#x20;

You should also be mindful of self-assessments by internal teams only without the right skillset, but also need to be careful not to engage only a third party (such as consultancy) so it does not seem a “negative audit.” A mixed team approach, with the right objectives alignment across teams, will deliver the best outcomes.

#### Designing Your AI Roadmap

Once you have assessed your company’s AI maturity level, you can begin designing your AI roadmap. This roadmap should include specific actions that need to be taken in each of the five pillars to achieve your desired AI maturity level.

The first pillar, company AI cross adoption, involves ensuring that AI is adopted and integrated into all aspects of the company’s operations. This may include developing an AI strategy and governance framework, identifying use cases for AI, and promoting a culture of innovation and experimentation.

The second pillar, governance and responsible AI, involves ensuring that AI is developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner. This may include establishing ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment, ensuring transparency and accountability in AI decision-making, and addressing potential biases in AI algorithms.

The third pillar, skills and diversity, involves ensuring that the company has the necessary AI skills and diversity to support AI adoption and innovation. This may include investing in AI education and training programs, promoting diversity and inclusion in AI development teams, and attracting and retaining top AI talent.

The fourth pillar, Infrastructure, involves investing in the necessary AI infrastructure to support AI development and deployment. This may include investing in cloud computing, data storage and processing, and AI hardware and software.

The fifth and final pillar, AI R\&D, involves investing in AI research and development to create innovative AI solutions. This may include developing new AI algorithms and models, exploring new AI applications, and investing in AI talent and partnerships.

Each company’s roadmap will be unique, depending on their starting point in the maturity model, how ambitious their target AI maturity is, and the required investment to cover the gap. The roadmap should include specific actions and timelines for each pillar, as well as metrics for measuring progress and success.

#### Sample AI Roadmap: Using the Gartner AI Framework

The first step in designing your AI roadmap is to assess your company’s current AI maturity level. This assessment will help you determine where your company stands in terms of AI adoption and identify the gaps that need to be addressed to achieve your desired AI maturity level.

An AI maturity model that is widely used is the Gartner AI Maturity Model, which consists of five levels, ranging from basic AI adoption to advanced AI capabilities. The following is a summary of the different levels in the Gartner AI Maturity Model:

* **Level 1 – No AI Adoption**: The organization has no experience or capability with AI.
* **Level 2 – Experimental**: The organization has started to experiment with AI and is beginning to develop basic skills and knowledge.
* **Level 3 – Operational**: The organization has deployed AI in some parts of the business and has developed some best practices for managing AI.
* **Level 4 – Embedded**: The organization has embedded AI into its operations and has developed a high level of AI expertise.
* **Level 5 – Innovative**: The organization is using AI to drive innovation and is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI.

In this example, we will focus on a company that wants to go from level 2 (Experimental) to level 4 (Embedded) in the Gartner AI Maturity Model. The exact timings will depend on the way to fund the different initiatives and the actual level of resources and infrastructure when starting the program. The following roadmap detailed the different actions to execute for each of the key five pillars:

1.  1.**Pillar 1: Company AI cross adoption**

    1.  a.

        Develop an AI strategy that aligns with business objectives and identifies potential use cases for AI.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Build cross-functional teams to develop and deploy AI solutions across the organization.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Create a roadmap for AI adoption across the organization, prioritizing high-impact use cases.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.**Pillar 2: Governance and responsible** **AI**

    1.  a.

        Design the right AI organization for your company. In this case, when a company is in maturity level 2, it is very likely all the AI teams are centralized, as the company matures and goes to level 4, it might be better to move some resources to the business units, although keeping the AI function with dotted line to the central team to align on AI guidelines, common tooling, and model management.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Establish companywide ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Ensure transparency and accountability in AI decision-making.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Develop a framework for assessing and managing AI risks, including potential biases in AI algorithms.

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        Algorithm development has a very challenging RoI that most companies cannot justify.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3.**Pillar 3: Skills and diversity**

    1.  a.

        Invest in AI education and training programs to upskill employees on AI technology and its applications.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Attract and retain top AI talent through competitive salaries and benefits.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Promote diversity and inclusion in AI development teams to drive innovation and avoid bias in AI algorithms.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
4.  4.**Pillar 4:** **Infrastructure**

    1.  a.

        Invest in cloud computing to support AI development and deployment. Ensure you have the right balance between on-premises and cloud environments.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Invest in AI hardware and software to support advanced AI capabilities. As the computing would be very intense, ensure you do very clear business cases why cloud would be more economical than in-house servers.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        As the company moves away from level 2, develop a plan for scaling infrastructure to support growing AI capabilities.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
5.  5.**Pillar 5: AI** **R\&D**

    1.  a.

        As the company starts in level 2, it is more efficient to leverage external resources and to establish the right level of partnerships with academia and key government organizations to drive innovation in AI.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        As the company progresses toward 4 or even 5, start developing new AI algorithms and models in areas that are a unique differentiation to the business. Unless your company is a technology giant, doing research on research on pure generic.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

Scaling AI in the enterprise is a complex process that requires a strategic and holistic approach. By addressing the five pillars of company AI cross adoption, governance and responsible AI, AI R\&D, skills and diversity, and infrastructure, companies can successfully scale AI in their enterprise. It is important for each company to assess their current AI maturity level and design a personalized AI roadmap that is tailored to their specific needs and goals. With a well-designed AI roadmap, companies can realize the full potential of AI and drive growth and innovation.

### Key Takeaways

Scaling AI in the enterprise is a complex and multifaceted challenge that requires a holistic approach. In this chapter, we covered five key pillars that companies must address to successfully scale AI: company AI cross-adoption, governance and responsible AI, AI R\&D, skills and diversity, and infrastructure.

* **Takeaway point 1: Constant focus on business value**. It is important to keep the focus on business value throughout the entire AI journey, from planning and implementation to scaling and adoption. This means being clear about the objectives and outcomes that you want to achieve, and continuously evaluating the success of AI initiatives in terms of those goals.
* **Takeaway point 2: Have the right team with focus**. Building the right team with a mix of data scientists, machine learning engineers, AI product managers, and other roles is crucial for executing AI projects and ensuring success. Additionally, it’s important to educate everyone in the organization about AI to build a culture of understanding and adoption.
* **Takeaway point 3: Where are we in the AI journey?** Understanding where your company is in the AI maturity journey is essential for making informed decisions about the resources, skills, and infrastructure you will need to scale AI effectively. For more mature companies, AI R\&D can be a competitive advantage, but for early-stage companies, it may not yet be a priority. Many companies will benefit to establish a maturity AI gap roadmap, where they are at a particular point of time, their AI maturity ambition and a detailed roadmap which specify all the specific actions in each of the five pillars companies must pursue over time. This document should also be reviewed and adjusted regularly, at least twice a year.

In conclusion, to successfully scale AI in the enterprise, it is important to have a constant focus on business value, build the right team with a focus on skills and diversity, and understand where your company is in the AI maturity journey. You will need to address all five pillars we have seen, and organizations can move forward with confidence in their AI initiatives and reap the rewards of successful scaling.

As this chapter marks the end of Part IV, we will move into the final part of the book, Part V, “The Future of AI.” Here we will explore some interesting developments, and as per the rest of the book, the objective will be to provide the reader with a set of future-proven First Principles to evaluate all the exciting new developments that no doubt will come over the next few years.
