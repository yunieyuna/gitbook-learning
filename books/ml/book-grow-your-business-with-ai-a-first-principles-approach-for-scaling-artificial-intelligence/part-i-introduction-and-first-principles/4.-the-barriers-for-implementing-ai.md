# 4. The Barriers for Implementing AI

This is the last chapter from Part I, “Introduction and First Principles.” We have focused so far, first, on understanding both the incredible potential but also some of the important risks of AI, and then drilling down on First Principles and potential challenges to implement AI. One of the main objectives of the book is to help people from all types of enterprises to be successful with their AI initiatives. You might have probably noticed I have not gone very deep into AI yet; indeed, there is a strong reason for this approach. While there are plenty of books which only focus on the technical aspects of AI projects, I strongly believe you need to really understand the reasons behind how it is so hard to implement AI, so you can then target a specific action plan for your enterprise. We spent Chapter [1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml) describing the core underlying issue, achieving effective communication across the ecosystem, which is sometimes referred as “the two cultures”[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1), how a separation of the scientific and humanities communities creates a gap in understanding across all society, which naturally includes the business world. In this chapter, we will go deeper into the most common challenges, and following the First Principles methodology, we will separate the issues that anyone implementing a new technology will encounter from the issues specific to artificial intelligence. This chapter will also show some techniques to overcome those barriers; however, as you will see, there is a strong dependency in the type and culture of the organization.

### Common Barriers Associated with Implementing Any New Technology

Implementing new technology is always challenging, regardless of the specific type of technology being implemented. The following barriers are common to any technology implementation and must be considered when implementing AI:

1.  1\.

    **Resistance to change**: Employees and stakeholders may resist new technology, fearing job displacement or disruptions to existing processes. To overcome resistance, organizations should communicate the benefits of AI, involve employees in the implementation process, and provide training and resources to help them adapt.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Lack of understanding/skills and expertise**: Successfully implementing new technology requires knowledge and expertise. Organizations can address this barrier by investing in upskilling their workforce, partnering with external experts, and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Business and strategy alignment**: Ensuring new technology aligns with an organization’s overall goals and strategies is crucial. To achieve alignment, organizations should develop a comprehensive strategy that outlines how AI can support their objectives and facilitate regular communication between business and technical stakeholders.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Change management best practices**: Effective change management is essential for successful technology implementation. Organizations should develop a change management plan that outlines objectives, timelines, and key activities, and ensure stakeholder engagement and cultural alignment throughout the process.

    &#x20;

### Barriers Specific to Artificial Intelligence

In addition to the common barriers associated with implementing new technology, AI initiatives face specific challenges due to the nature of the technology. The following are the key barriers specific to AI implementation:

1.  1\.

    **Outdated management guidelines**: Many management guidelines in use today were established in the 1950s and 1970s, and they do not fully account for the rapid advancements in technology and data processing capabilities. As a result, organizations might struggle to adapt to the changes brought about by AI adoption. Business leaders need to update their management approaches to align with the evolving technological landscape and take advantage of the opportunities AI offers.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Language barrier**: Bridging the gap between business-minded and technical-minded stakeholders is critical for AI projects. Establishing a common language and understanding can be achieved through regular meetings, workshops, and cross-functional collaboration. We will also discuss “the two cultures” by C.P. Snow, where the miscommunication gap between the scientific and humanity community is having a profound impact in society, including business.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Data and infrastructure**: AI technologies rely on data quality, storage, and processing power. Organizations may face challenges related to data management and infrastructure. To address these issues, businesses should invest in modernizing their data infrastructure, implementing robust data governance policies, and utilizing cloud-based solutions.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Governance and regulation**: AI adoption brings legal and regulatory considerations, such as data privacy, security, and compliance. Organizations must ensure they meet these requirements by conducting regular audits, establishing a dedicated AI ethics committee, and staying informed about the latest regulatory developments.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Metrics and measurement**: Establishing clear key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics is vital for measuring the success of AI initiatives. Organizations should develop a set of quantitative and qualitative metrics to track progress and evaluate AI’s impact on the business.

    &#x20;

Organizations can maximize the benefits of AI and drive significant value, once they have a deep understanding of these barriers, so they can produce a specific plan addressing these barriers to their success. The larger the organization, the most important the people/culture elements are, versus in smaller organization the technical barriers can have a larger impact. In the rest of the chapter, we will go deep into each of these nine barriers.

### Barrier 1: Resistance to Change

One of the most significant barriers to implementing AI (and pretty much any new technology/process) in a company is resistance to change. Employees and stakeholders may resist the implementation of AI for a variety of reasons, including fear of job loss, lack of understanding, and concerns about the impact on company culture. In this section, we will explore these reasons in more detail and discuss strategies to address this barrier. Using a First Principles approach, we can break down the core components of this resistance and explore strategies to address them effectively.

Core components of resistance to change:

1.  1\.

    **Fear of job loss**: Employees may be concerned that AI will automate their tasks, rendering their roles obsolete.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Lack of understanding**: Some employees might not comprehend the full potential of AI and how it can benefit the organization, leading to resistance.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Employees may worry that the introduction of AI will result in a **significant shift in the company’s values and culture**, impacting their work environment.

    &#x20;

The following are some typical strategies to address resistance to change:

1.  1\.

    **Clear communication**: Ensure open and transparent communication about the purpose and benefits of AI implementation. Educate employees on how AI can enhance their roles and contribute to the company’s growth. Address concerns and misconceptions to help build understanding and trust.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Employee involvement**: Involve employees in the decision-making and implementation process. Encourage their input and feedback, and actively listen to their concerns. This sense of ownership and participation can help reduce resistance.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Training and reskilling**: Invest in employee training to help them acquire the necessary skills to work with AI technologies. This can alleviate fears of job loss and create a more adaptable workforce.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Showcase success stories**: Share examples of how AI has benefited other organizations, both internally and externally. Demonstrating the positive impact of AI can help employees understand its potential and foster acceptance.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Address cultural concerns**: Reinforce the organization’s commitment to its core values and culture. Emphasize that AI is a tool to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. Support a culture that embraces innovation while preserving the organization’s unique identity.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    **Establish AI champions**: Identify and empower key individuals within the organization to advocate for AI adoption. These champions can help drive change by sharing their knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm with their colleagues.

    &#x20;

This barrier will be present in all organizations, so it is important to address it adequately, and the action plan is adapted to each enterprise’s specific characteristics such as size and culture. When organizations fully understand the core components of resistance to change, they can create a unique environment that is more receptive to AI adoption. Incorporating relevant examples, data, and visual aids can further illustrate the benefits of embracing AI, fostering a culture of innovation and growth. Companies should prioritize education, governance, communication, involvement, and upskilling to help address resistance and promote a smooth transition to AI-powered workflows.

### Barrier 2: Lack of Understanding and Expertise

One key barrier to implementing AI in organizations is the lack of understanding and expertise. To successfully adopt AI, it is crucial for organizations to develop the necessary skills and knowledge in their workforce. This subsection will provide an overview of the essential skills and knowledge for AI implementation and strategies to build and develop expertise within an organization.

The following are essential skills and knowledge for AI implementation:

1.  1\.

    **Data literacy**: Employees should be able to interpret and analyze data, as well as understand the importance of data quality and integrity. This point is often underestimated by organizations, as the overall data literacy levels of the population of most countries are quite low. In the USA, it is estimated that the lack of data literacy, when it comes to finance, costed each American $1,819 in 2022.[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) The survey is quite revealing, as most people will fail to grasp basic math’s concepts. AI requires quite a bit of background on Statistics and Advanced Math; hence there is a very large gap, and many training courses fail because they assume a basic level which is simply not there.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **AI/ML techniques**: Familiarity with various AI and machine learning algorithms, their applications, and the ability to choose the appropriate technique for a given problem. It is important there is an orchestrated training program, as the worse situation is to let teams to just listen to the myths from the media, which by design focus on the negative and rarely offer an overall unbiased view of each situation.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Programming and software skills**: Knowledge of programming languages (e.g., Python, R) and tools commonly used in AI development, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. We will list these in later chapters.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Domain expertise**: Understanding the specific industry or business context in which AI will be applied, enabling more effective solutions.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Ethical considerations**: Awareness of ethical implications, including data privacy, security, and fairness, is crucial for responsible AI implementation.

    &#x20;

The following strategies can be used to address the lack of understanding and expertise:

1.  1\.

    **Training programs**: Implement comprehensive training programs to develop the necessary AI skills among existing employees. This could include workshops, online courses, or partnering with educational institutions. It is also recommended to target specific courses for specific audiences – for instance, one set for senior management, one for middle management, and a wider course for all the workforce. A good example of online resources is the NLP “TutorialBank,” a collections of learning resources to learn NLP.[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3)

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Hire AI talent**: Recruit skilled AI professionals, such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI strategists, to build a dedicated AI team.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Collaboration and knowledge sharing**: Encourage collaboration between technical and non-technical teams to facilitate knowledge sharing and improve overall AI understanding within the organization.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **External partnerships**: Collaborate with external AI experts, consultancies, or research institutions to access specialized knowledge and accelerate AI implementation. Most governments have set up national AI plans to accelerate AI as a competitive advantage, and as part of those roadmap government-backed groups and agencies are created to promote AI. For instance, in the UK, “The Alan Turing institute” [4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4) provides plenty of thought AI leadership and industry collaboration programs that enterprises can take advantage of.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Continuous learning**: Foster a culture of continuous learning and professional development to ensure that employees stay up-to-date with the latest AI advancements and techniques. The good news is that there are plenty of resources online, many free for people to learn. We will explore some of these resources later in the book.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    **Mentoring and coaching**: Establish mentorship programs where experienced AI practitioners guide and support less experienced employees in developing their AI skills.

    &#x20;

### Barrier 3: Business and Strategy Alignment

Another barrier to AI implementation is ensuring that new technology aligns with an organization’s overall goals and strategies. This is a very important barrier which very few businesses managed to get it right. Achieving alignment is critical to realizing the full potential of AI in driving business growth and innovation. This subsection will outline strategies for aligning AI initiatives with business objectives and facilitating regular communication between business and technical stakeholders.

In the journey of growing your enterprise with AI, it is crucial to ensure that the overall business strategy encompasses the strategic capabilities of AI. This requires a thorough understanding of the technology, its potential, and the best way to leverage it for business growth. However, one of the most prominent barriers to achieving this harmony is the lack of communication between management and AI tech teams. This communication barrier is reminiscent of the divide between the “two cultures” as described by C.P. Snow. In his seminal work, _The Two Cultures_, C.P. Snow outlines the cultural chasm between the scientific and social science worlds, where professionals from each realm struggle to communicate effectively with one another. This division often leads to misunderstandings and missed opportunities for collaboration, and the same is true for the AI business landscape.

To overcome this barrier and ensure that the overall business strategy is infused with AI’s strategic capabilities, both management and AI tech teams must strive to bridge the communication gap. Here are typical strategies to address the business and strategy alignment barrier:

1.  1\.

    **Foster mutual** **understanding; engage executive leadership**: Secure commitment from top-level executives by demonstrating the potential value of AI and its alignment with the organization’s strategic vision. Executive sponsorship can help drive AI adoption and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. Encourage cross-functional training and workshops for both management and AI tech teams. This will allow both sides to understand each other’s language, objectives, and constraints, fostering empathy and easing communication.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Develop a comprehensive AI strategy; establish clear goals**: Create a clear and well-defined AI strategy that outlines how AI can support the organization’s objectives. This should include identifying specific use cases, setting measurable goals, and determining the resources required for AI implementation. Align your AI initiatives with your overall business objectives. Ensure that the AI tech teams understand the business goals and that management is aware of the technical possibilities and limitations of AI.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Establish a** **cross-functional** **AI team**: Create a team comprising members from various departments, including IT, data science, and relevant business units. Ensure the right governance is in place – where all team members have aligned incentives and/or objectives. This diverse team can help ensure that AI initiatives are aligned with business goals and that stakeholders’ concerns are addressed.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Regular communication and collaboration**: Facilitate open and transparent communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. Regular meetings, workshops, and updates can help keep everyone informed about AI initiatives and their progress, ensuring alignment with business objectives. Create opportunities for interdisciplinary teamwork, where management and AI tech teams can work together on projects, share ideas, and solve problems collectively. This will not only bridge the communication gap but also bring about innovative solutions that leverage AI’s capabilities to drive business growth.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Designate AI ambassadors**: Identify individuals who can act as liaisons between management and AI tech teams. These ambassadors should be skilled in both business and technology and can help translate objectives, requirements, and progress updates between the two groups

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    **Prioritize AI projects based on value and feasibility**: Evaluate AI initiatives based on their potential impact on business objectives and their feasibility in terms of resources and technology. Focus on projects that provide the most significant value while being achievable within the organization’s constraints.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    **Monitor and adjust AI initiatives and** **emphasize communication**: Regularly assess the progress of AI projects and their alignment with business goals. Be prepared to adjust or change direction based on feedback, performance metrics, or changes in business priorities. Encourage continuous open and transparent communication across all levels of the organization. This includes regular updates, feedback sessions, and brainstorming meetings where both management and AI tech teams can discuss challenges, opportunities, and AI-related developments.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    **Develop success stories**: Demonstrate the value of AI by showcasing successful implementations and their impact on the organization’s goals. These success stories can serve as examples to reinforce the alignment between AI initiatives and business strategies.

    &#x20;

By incorporating these strategies, organizations can break down the barriers between the two cultures and create a unified, AI-driven business strategy. This will not only ensure that AI’s strategic capabilities are fully leveraged but will also empower the organization to adapt and innovate in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. Table [4-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1) is a comparison table which highlights the key differences between traditional business strategy approaches and AI-enabled strategy approaches.Table 4-1&#x20;

The key differences between traditional business strategy approaches and AI-enabled strategy approaches

| Aspect                                     | Traditional business strategy approaches                                                 | AI-enabled strategy approaches                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal-setting                               | Based on historical performance, market trends, and human intuition                      | Utilizes AI-generated insights, simulations, and predictive analytics to inform and refine goals                           |
| Data-driven decision-making                | Decisions are made using limited datasets, often based on past experiences and intuition | Harnesses vast amounts of data from multiple sources, enabling real-time decision-making and continuous optimization       |
| Adaptability                               | Reactive to change, requiring manual adjustment to strategy and a longer time to adapt   | Proactive and self-learning, capable of adapting in real-time based on new data and market conditions                      |
| Resource allocation                        | Primarily based on budgeting and forecasting using historical data and trends            | AI-powered algorithms dynamically allocate resources based on current data and performance metrics                         |
| Market analysis                            | Periodic and manual analysis of market trends, competitors, and customer needs           | Continuous, automated analysis of market conditions, competitive landscape, and customer preferences using AI tools        |
| Risk management                            | Risk assessment and mitigation is often subjective and based on past experiences         | AI-driven predictive analytics help identify potential risks and suggest mitigation strategies in real-time                |
| Innovation and competitive advantage       | Incremental innovation based on known business models and technologies                   | Breakthrough innovation by leveraging AI’s capabilities to identify new opportunities and create unique value propositions |

### Barrier 4: Change Management

Effective change management is essential for successful technology implementation, including AI adoption. Organizations should develop a change management plan that outlines objectives, timelines, and key activities, and ensures stakeholder engagement and cultural alignment throughout the process. This subsection will highlight strategies for managing change and overcoming potential challenges during AI implementation.

The following are typical strategies to address change management barriers:

1.  1\.

    **Develop a change management plan**: Create a structured plan that includes clear objectives, timelines, and key activities to guide the organization through the AI implementation process. This plan should outline the desired outcomes and establish a framework for managing change.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Identify key stakeholders**: Determine the individuals and groups within the organization who will be directly or indirectly affected by the AI implementation. Engage these stakeholders early in the process to understand their needs, concerns, and expectations.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Communicate the vision and benefits**: Clearly communicate the purpose of the AI initiative, its expected benefits, and how it aligns with the organization’s strategic objectives. This communication should be ongoing and tailored to different stakeholder groups to ensure understanding and buy-in.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Provide training and support**: Offer comprehensive training and support for employees affected by the AI implementation. This includes technical training for new tools and systems, as well as support for adapting to new processes and workflows.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    **Foster a culture of innovation and adaptability**: Encourage a culture that embraces change, innovation, and continuous learning. This will help employees to be more open and adaptable to new technologies such as AI.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    **Celebrate successes and learn from failures**: Recognize and celebrate the milestones and successes achieved during the AI implementation process. Additionally, analyze and learn from any setbacks or challenges encountered along the way to inform future initiatives.

    &#x20;

Lastly, there are several change management frameworks; Figure [4-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1) describes the popular Kotter’s 8-step model.[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5)

### Barrier 5: Outdated Management Practices

The foundation of most MBA programs is influenced by a few management gurus such as **Michael Porter** and its five forces framework, **Tom Peters**, **W. Edwards Deming**, **Clayton Christensen** and his “jobs-to-be-done,” and many others. Among all of them, **Peter Drucker** is widely considered the father of modern management theory. Therefore, most companies today are managed following these principles developed in the 1950s and 1970s. Nevertheless, in the 2020+, the era of data and AI, Peter Drucker’s key principle of enterprise management, which states that “Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs,” may no longer fully encompass the breadth of value creation opportunities that modern organizations have at their disposal. While marketing and innovation remain essential components of business success, the rapid rise of data and AI has introduced new dimensions to the value generation process that traditional management techniques may not adequately address.

Traditional management techniques often emphasize top-down decision-making, rigid hierarchies, and well-defined roles and responsibilities. However, the dynamic nature of data and AI requires organizations to adopt more agile, collaborative, and adaptive approaches to remain competitive. By leveraging data and AI effectively, organizations can generate insights, optimize processes, enhance customer experiences, and create new business models that were previously unattainable.

#### The Need for Evolving Management Practices for AI

Traditional management techniques may miss the point about leveraging data and AI in several ways:

* **Limited focus on data-driven decision-making**: Traditional management may prioritize experience and intuition over data-driven insights. However, in the era of data and AI, harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning can lead to more accurate, timely, and informed decisions, ultimately driving better business outcomes.
* **Inadequate investment in data infrastructure and talent**: Traditional management may not recognize the importance of investing in robust data infrastructure, AI technologies, and skilled talent to capitalize on the value of data. The lack of investment in these areas can hinder an organization’s ability to fully harness the potential of data and AI. Organizations must strategically invest in upskilling their workforce and identifying the right talent for AI projects.
* **Resistance to change and innovation**: Traditional management techniques may foster resistance to change and innovation, particularly when it comes to adopting new technologies like AI. Embracing a culture of continuous learning and experimentation is essential for organizations to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.
* **Organizational structure** **– insufficient cross-functional collaboration**: Traditional management structures often emphasize departmental silos, which can impede effective collaboration between technical and non-technical teams. Leveraging data and AI often requires a diverse set of skills and perspectives, necessitating cross-functional collaboration for successful implementation. AI-driven organizations may need to adopt more agile, cross-functional team structures that enable collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
* **Performance management**: Traditional performance evaluation methods may not be suitable for AI projects, which often require a different set of success metrics and evaluation criteria, both in technical performance but also financially, as the economics of AI projects is different from classical technologies.
* **Lack of emphasis on ethical AI**: Traditional management techniques may not fully address the ethical implications of AI and data-driven decision-making. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into business operations, it is crucial for organizations to prioritize ethical considerations and develop robust governance frameworks that ensure responsible AI adoption.

By recognizing and addressing the limitations of traditional management techniques in the era of data and AI, organizations can unlock new opportunities for value creation and drive transformative growth. This requires embracing a culture of data-driven decision-making, investing in the necessary infrastructure and talent, fostering innovation, promoting cross-functional collaboration, and prioritizing ethical AI adoption. With these shifts in management practices, businesses can fully harness the power of data and AI to revolutionize their industries and create lasting competitive advantages.

#### Strategies for Updating Management Guidelines to Accommodate AI

To keep pace with AI’s rapid advancements, organizations need to update their management guidelines to support AI implementation effectively. Here are several strategies that can help organizations update their management practices to accommodate AI:

* **Encourage a data-driven culture**: A data-driven culture values evidence-based decision-making and embraces AI-generated insights. Encouraging data-driven decision-making can help organizations make better use of AI capabilities.
* **Adopt agile methodologies**: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote iterative development and continuous improvement. By adopting agile methodologies, organizations can ensure their management practices can respond more quickly to the dynamic nature of AI projects.
* **Foster cross-functional collaboration**: AI projects often require a diverse set of skills, including data scientists, engineers, and business experts. Encouraging cross-functional collaboration can ensure that all necessary skills are available and that different perspectives are considered during the AI implementation process. Some large enterprises are making mandatory for all new projects before obtaining funding, to present a section on how Data Science (AI/ML) will be applied.
*   **Develop new** **performance evaluation criteria**: Traditional performance evaluation methods may not accurately capture the success of AI projects. Organizations should develop new performance evaluation criteria that focus on AI-specific metrics, such as model accuracy, data quality, and business impact. Table [4-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grow-your-business/9781484296691/html/605840\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2) is a comparison table that highlights the differences between traditional performance evaluation criteria and AI-specific performance evaluation criteria for projects within the enterprise. As AI projects become more prevalent, organizations must adapt their performance evaluation methods to ensure that they are accurately measuring the success of AI-driven initiatives and making well-informed decisions.Table 4-2&#x20;

    Evaluation criteria for projects: traditional vs AI-based ones

    | Aspect                              | Traditional performance evaluation criteria                                         | AI-specific performance evaluation criteria                                                                        |

  * Addressing this barrier requires fostering a culture of cross-disciplinary collaboration and ensuring that both technical and non-technical team members have a basic understanding of AI concepts and applications.
* **Takeaway point 3**: **the importance of a comprehensive plan to address barriers**
  * To ensure the successful implementation of AI, organizations must have a comprehensive plan in place to address both the common barriers to new technologies and the AI-specific challenges.
  * This plan should include effective communication strategies, ongoing training and support, and a focus on fostering a culture of collaboration and understanding across teams.
  * By addressing the human implementation factor, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI and drive significant value for their business.

As this chapter marks the end of Part I, “Introduction and First Principles,” we will move into the next part of the book, Part II, “The WHY.” Here we will explore the reasons why companies should invest in AI. This is an area where, like other new technologies, I have seen many organizations jumping right into the solution and implementation (“the WHAT” and “the HOW”) without fully understanding both the foundations and the business rationale and more importantly whether they should do it or not. Over the next three chapters, we will go a bit deeper into what is exactly AI and its role in the enterprise, current AI trends, and how to achieve an effective data monetization with AI across the enterprise.
