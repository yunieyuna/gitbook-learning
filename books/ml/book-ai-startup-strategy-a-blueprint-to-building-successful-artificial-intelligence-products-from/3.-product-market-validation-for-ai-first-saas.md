# 3. Product-Market Validation for AI-First SaaS

Successful AI startups need to understand the nature of AI technology and how it is bought and used. AI is an enabling technology – a set of tools and technologies that can be applied to solve numerous use cases. Therefore, AI will enable many use cases for enterprises – AI can solve substantial inefficiencies in the corporates and even create a whole new business. Netflix, Amazon, and Uber are examples of companies where AI enables business models.

Due to this enabling nature, an AI product is targeted mainly at enterprise or technical users (at least until OpenAI releases ChatGPT). AI companies whose core product is AI are generally in B2B space (selling to business users) or B2D space (selling to developers). However, picking the most suitable domain, use cases, and industry where AI will contribute to the optimal business value is not trivial. Most AI products fail because AI companies are not doing proper product-market (P-M) validation.

This chapter will focus on properly validating AI products for enterprises (B2B). We will first introduce you to the difference between traditional SaaS, AI-first SaaS, AI-powered SaaS, and AI as a Service (AlaaS).

AI-first product validation is the most important step for the success of an AI startup. We have been building a very comprehensive framework on that.

To validate your AI-first SaaS solution, we will guide you through a step-by-step approach: define the ideal founder characteristics, determine the target industry, recruit early adopters, create an AI Minimal Viable Product, and close the deal with a service contract.

This approach is critical to the success of your AI startup. It allows you to test your solution with early adopters and refine it based on their feedback. Following this approach increases your chances of success in the market validation process. However, it requires effort and dedication. With the right team, industry focus, and approach, your AI-first SaaS solution can achieve success in the market.

### SaaS and Its Evolution

In this section, the fundamental concept of AI-first SaaS will be explained. AI-first SaaS is the B2B business model of an AI startup, and it is a common model and, usually, the second stage of an AI startup after the AI service model has been validated. But before we explain about AI-first SaaS, we will walk through the concept of SaaS and the difference between AI-first SaaS, AI-powered SaaS, and AIaaS.

#### What Is SaaS

SaaS is short for _Software as a Service._ It is a model of software delivery based on a subscription-based software model. Enterprises embrace the new technology to minimize the high aggregate cost of buying traditional software licenses. Not only do businesses have this problem, but they also pay hefty annual maintenance fees every time an upgrade or update is in market; it can be quite costly. SaaS businesses differ from traditional software companies because they don’t require an end user license. Instead, the company’s servers host all the customer data and offer them access at any time without additional cost or hassle – it just requires logging into their account, which can be done on demand through either the Web or even mobile phone. Examples of SaaS are CRM applications such as Salesforce and HubSpot, as well as Zendesk for customer service ticketing systems.

Most SaaS is targeted at enterprise customers. But there is also another minority of SaaS targeted exclusively to consumers (B2C or business to consumer), such as Netflix and Spotify. A trending category of SaaS also serves both the business and consumer markets, such as Shopify and Canva.

#### From SaaS to AI-Powered SaaS to AI-First SaaS

Historically, SaaS emerged from the rise of cloud computing. The idea that web-based software installed on a third-party remote server reduced the necessary maintenance and could be accessed from anywhere was exciting for small and medium businesses. In its infancy, the SaaS model was thought to be only for startups and small businesses because it was too slow and unstable. But over the next several years, improvements to the Internet infrastructure, database, and web application technology stacks speed up the adoption of SaaS.

SaaS is also evolved. We can observe that fundamentally four different innovation trends have shaped the SaaS industry over the past 15 years, as described in Figure [3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="567" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

At the high level, here is how we categorize it:

*   _Workflow SaaS_: Initially, SaaS companies built a web application consisting of the workflow with a database and basic CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operation to help their users simplify their business process. This type of workflow SaaS helps the users with different standardized business processes such as

    * _Customer relationship management_: Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive
    * _Project and task management_: Asana, Basecamp, ClickUp
    * _Accounting_: QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite
    * _Customer support and ticketing_: Freshdesk, Zendesk, ServiceNow

    This type of SaaS is disrupting the software industry by providing low-cost, available-from-anywhere web-based applications, which can be integrated into the business process of users.
* _Developer tool SaaS_: In the second category, some SaaS companies started building picks and shovels of SaaS applications, making software development much more efficient by abstracting underlying complexity into APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) or SDKs. Twilio, QuickBlox, SendGrid, and Nexmo are developer tool SaaS popular with developers and make the development work more efficient. This type of SaaS disrupts the way a developer works by simplifying the complex development part into components that can be easily integrated into their applications.
* _AI-powered SaaS_: In the third category, the workflow SaaS company realizes that their web application is collecting the data into their database. Still, there is no mechanism for automatically analyzing, optimizing or mining the data. On the other hand, the customer also demands to perform forecasting, prediction, and analysis of the data. This leads the SaaS companies to infuse a kind of intelligent algorithm into their SaaS, such as a machine learning or optimization algorithm, hence the term _AI-powered SaaS_. Almost all leading workflow SaaS are adopting AI now as part of the SaaS evolution. An example of AI-powered SaaS is Salesforce Einstein, which is a set of AI technologies that make the customer success platform smarter. Zendesk is also proudly called an AI-powered SaaS by adopting AI for ticketing using text analysis, that is, sentiment analysis to classify tickets. Zendesk also has a chatbot to solve simple requests from customers. Salesforce and Zendesk are also known for their appetite for AI startup acquisitions. Salesforce is acquiring AI startups MetaMind, Datorama, and Bonobo, while Zendesk acquired AI startups Cleverly and Momentive to expand the AI capabilities of their SaaS platform.
*   _AI-first SaaS_: The fourth category is SaaS companies that use AI algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, mathematical optimization, and machine learning, _at their core_ to scale some intelligence to their customers.

    _AI at its core_ means that AI capabilities have always been an unseparated part of the architectural design of the product since day one. AI is not something added or infused to the product, but it is the essence of the product. AI-first SaaS has one main goal: _augmenting human intelligence_. This means that AI-first SaaS will be able to make their users able _to stop_ doing some cognitive tasks. Without _AI at its core_, AI-first SaaS doesn’t have any value proposition. Examples of AI-first companies are

    * _Narrative Science_: Their product enables users to _tell a story_ from the data, such as sales and expenditure data. This means that their users will _stop writing reports_ and let the AI write the report for them.
    * _Advance AI_: Their onboarding automation product enables their users to verify the identity of their customers just by their selfie faces and ID pictures. The proposition is that the users will _stop doing manual ID verification_ by live interviewing with their customers. Instead, the customer ID can be verified by only taking a selfie because Advance AI utilizes deep learning–based biometrics matching.
    * _Locus.sh_: Their product enables their users to automate the logistics routing and dispatching jobs. The proposition is that their users will stop doing manual logistics routing using Excel and whiteboards and stop doing manual dispatching with the phone.

The main difference between AI-powered and AI-first SaaS is that AI-powered SaaS still functions very well even without AI because it is a workflow SaaS on steroids. In contrast, AI-first SaaS cannot function without AI because AI is the core product.

The following is the multitude of benefits of adopting AI-first SaaS for companies:

* _Reduced time and cost_: Building AI is timely and costly. Companies must hire expensive AI experts to build, test, and implement AI systems from scratch. The infrastructure cost for AI development and operationalization is also staggering.
* _Ease of use_: Packaging the AI algorithms as a product with a user interface allows the customers (business users and end users) to use the AI solution easily without requiring expertise.
* _Scalability_: As the AI-first SaaS is usually charged by subscription (pay per use), customers can first experiment with whether AI solves their problems. The uncertainties can be alleviated by starting small and scaling later as the value is proven or the company requirements change.
* _Flexibility_: Flexibility in AI-first SaaS allows the product to adapt to changing needs, relying on machine learning to continuously improve capabilities. It can be achieved through customizability, scalability, and integration with other systems, ensuring the product remains useful and relevant as user needs evolve.
* _A step toward an AI-first company_: As the company starts to get the taste of using AI to support their daily business operations, they are starting to experience the efficiency and benefits and adopt an AI-first and data-driven mindset. This mindset is important for the transformation of the company toward an AI-first company.

#### AI as a Service (AIaaS)

There is also another category of product that uses AI at its core called AI as a Service (AIaaS). AIaaS is productizing only the AI modules and selling them as a service to be consumed by _developers_ as SDK or API. We can think of AIaaS as developer tool SaaS’s more intelligent evolution. The main difference between AIaaS and AI-first SaaS is the target user. AIaaS targets developers and data scientists because it is an AI engine, while AI-first SaaS is an AI engine + user interface – it targets business users like other B2B SaaS (see Figure [3-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="519" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

As we have described in a previous chapter, AIaaS is divided into three categories: AI platform, which provides end-to-end AI development and deployment solutions, such as Amazon Sagemaker and IBM Watson; AI tools, which offer features such as data annotation, model monitoring, and machine learning performance optimization, such as Fiddler, OctoML, and Scale AI; and AI engine, which provides pre-built AI models or environments as a service through APIs or SDKs, such as FaceTec for face biometrics, Routific for delivery routing optimization, and OpenALPR for license plate and vehicle recognition.

The benefits of AIaaS for their users are

* _Reduced time and cost_: Using AIaaS, developers and data scientists can save time and cost in building their platforms and AI models. Gluing open source AI solutions together is painstakingly difficult and time-consuming. An AI team can use a ready-made full-stack platform provided by an AIaaS platform provider. Sometimes, technical teams undermine the effort (time, cost, and cognitive load) needed to build acceptable AI solutions. Building a production-ready AI solution is not an easy thing and often not pennyworth, especially if it is not part of the company’s core business.
* _Ease of use_: AIaaS provides ready-made AI models from computer vision to recommender systems, which developers can easily consume without the machine learning experience and massive data needed.
* _Scalability_: The developers and data scientists can do trials on available commercial AIaaS to see if their AI solution suits them compared with in-house development. If it is more practical to use AIaaS, the team can easily scale up the usage.
* _Configurability_: Configurability in AI as a Service allows users to customize AI models and services for specific needs, enabling better accuracy and decision-making. It provides flexibility for experimentation and quick adaptation to changes, ultimately improving business outcomes and driving innovation.

Based on the preceding explanation, what is defined as an AI startup is an AI-first SaaS and AIaaS. Therefore, we will focus on these two business models.

#### Understanding the Fundamental Principles of SaaS

Whether we are building workflow SaaS, AI-powered SaaS, AI-first SaaS, or AIaaS, we need to understand that there are fundamental principles that cannot be violated in the SaaS business. These principles apply universally in any country and industry where SaaS operates. The principles are as follows:

1.  1\.

    **Target a specific market segment**. Do not target a market segment that is too broad. This applies to all categories of SaaS.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Focus on the target market and** **one value proposition**. Have a strong value proposition in one particular market. Create a SaaS product with a clear value proposition that solves _one_ problem properly for one industry. AI must reduce or remove at least _one_ problem that takes up customers’ time, money, and cognitive loads, better than anyone on the market. Then from that, we can explore other problems in that market and then other problems in adjacent industries. Too many entrepreneurs are trying to solve problems in too many industries. This is a recipe for SaaS disaster.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Track the competition.** Put special attention on the competitive and substitution landscape. This is especially true for AI-first SaaS and AIaaS startups. But unlike traditional SaaS, where the differentiation can be on the number and variety of features, AI products do not need to have many features. We just need one or two core features that solve a customer problem, that is, reducing their work and cognitive loads. So we track our closest competitors and benchmark our AI solutions in terms of product _smartness_, reliability, and user experience. Aside from competitors, we also need to consider humans as our competitors because we are trying to replicate human cognitive systems. We have to make sure that the AI solutions have an edge compared with humans, that is, cost, precision, consistency, and scale.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    **Never assume that customers want to change the way they work.** We must understand that customers are motivated to adopt SaaS to solve their problems seamlessly with minimum effort and cost. Therefore, we cannot assume that customers are willing to change their workflow and how they work. Make sure you pick a use case where the workflow is as generic as possible. Otherwise, you have to make sure that customers’ workflow can be customized and configured by them without making it too complicated to use.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    **Hang out with your customers**. We need to understand and love the customers in our target industry. Therefore, we have to enjoy hanging out with them. Especially for AI startup founders, we need to understand the most painful problem of the customers, which takes lots of money, time, and cognitive load.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    **Recruit early adopters**. Early adopters are crucial as part of SaaS development. For AI startups, early adopters help you frame a correct problem to solve and the solutions and provide real-world datasets and edge cases.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    **Be a consultant first, but draw the line**. Starting a SaaS journey as a solution consultant is a good idea. We can understand customers’ problems and expectations more and start collecting datasets (with some terms and agreement) and use cases. As described in the previous chapter, for AI startups, it is almost mandatory that we start from the consulting stage before we build a productized version of the solution in the form of AI-first SaaS or AIaaS. However, we must be strategic in determining which target market to choose and specific problem to solve, to avoid being trapped in the consulting stage forever. The end goal is to become a scalable and valuable AI startup.

    &#x20;

### Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) and Validation Framework

SaaS investment is very attractive for venture capital because SaaS businesses provide predictable, recurring revenue. A monthly CRM or HR SaaS subscription is a repeatable, secure income that can be grown by acquiring more subscriptions, compared with a one-off payment of a perpetual license or one-time project fees. SaaS startups can take up as many subscribers as they want with relatively the same fixed costs. This potentially creates high revenue and business scalability.

However, 92% of SaaS companies failed within three years despite growth and funding.[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1)

The number one cause of SaaS failure is non-existent product-market fit. Other reasons are a cash flow problem, more churn than growth, and poor management.[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) For deep technology–driven AI-centric products such as AI-powered SaaS, AI-first SaaS, and AIaaS, there is another dominant reason: unmet customer expectations because of the maturity of AI technology. Therefore, technical feasibility is also important in deep tech–driven products such as AI solutions.

So, in AI-centric products, product-market fit is not enough. We also need to do Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) fit. Product-Market-Technology validation is often skipped due to time and cost constraints. This often results in very negative consequences.

In this section, we will learn about the concept of Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) validation.

#### Product-Market Validation Fundamental

Product-market validation is a method of validating the market to ensure that the product answers a customer’s problem. The product-market validation method is about minimizing risk and validating product concepts within its target market. Product-market validation will reduce reliance on intuition, which is unreliable.

Several factors need to be considered when validating product-market fit:

1.  1\.

    _Market size_: The size of the potential market for this product.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Competition_: The number of direct and indirect competitors for the product.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Need_: The need of the customers of the product because it does solve their problem.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Willingness to pay_: The willingness of the customer to put a commercial value on the product and pay for it.

    &#x20;
5.  5._Business value_: The business value for the customers resulting from the usage of this product. It consists of three things:

    * _Financial value_: Quantified financial ROI and payback period
    * _Nonfinancial value_: The business value other than financial such as customer satisfaction improvement or risk mitigation
    * _Strategic value_: The potential of the product to influence the long-term strategy goal (three to five years), including the business model, operating model, and digital transformation

    &#x20;

The main question to be asked for product-market validation is

> _“Does this product have a reasonable market size that needs the product and is willing to pay?”_

There are fundamentally five steps on how to do product-market validation:

1.  1\.

    Write down the hypothesis about the customer and their problem, target market, and value proposition.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Assess the market size and share. Estimate the potential size of the market minus the competition.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Assess the investment and technology ecosystem.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Conduct interviews with your target customers.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Test the product and service to early adopters.

    &#x20;

Product-market validation aims to attain a product-market fit (P-M fit). P-M fit is a state where the product is already validated for one particular need of the market.

#### Product-Technology Validation Fundamental

Product-technology validation is the process of validating the technology needed to realize the product’s potential. This is especially important in the deep tech field such as space exploration, quantum computing, advanced material, artificial intelligence, biotech, and cleantech, where the technical uncertainty is still very high, and there are still few proven real-life implementation frameworks that have been successfully and comprehensively written.

To validate the product-technology fit, we need to measure three important factors:

1.  1\.

    _Technical feasibility_: The process of proving that state-of-the-art algorithms, engineering methods, and infrastructure (i.e., compute, storage, network bandwidth) are technically viable within some operational conditions.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Data feasibility_: The viability of the data and its acquisition process to make the product work by considering volume, characteristics, bias, privacy, and imbalance of data.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)_: The development, implementation, and maintenance costs to make the product work at a reasonable price.

    &#x20;

The main question to be asked for product-technology validation is

> _“Is the current state of technology and data needed for this product to work feasible at a reasonable cost?”_

There are four steps on how to do product-technology validation:

1.  1\.

    Write down the problem the product solves.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Assess the viability of the state-of-the-art algorithms to solve the problem mentioned in no. 1.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Assess whether we can acquire the data needed to solve the problem in a reasonable time.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Assess the total cost needed to develop and maintain the technology and its support systems.

    &#x20;

In AI-first SaaS and AIaaS, product-technology validation is crucial to ensure that the current state of technologies can solve the technical challenges expected for the product to be successful.

#### Product-Market-Technology Validation

Finally, for a deep tech product to be viable, we need to assess both the market and technology feasibility. The Product-Market-Technology fit is crucial in the tech-driven product because the product and technology often come first before the market is ready (see Figure [3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)). On the other hand, when the market is ready, the technology and its supporting ecosystem may not be mature yet. Therefore, a Product-Market-Technology fit is expected in deep techs, such as AI-centric products.

The framework for validating AI-first products based on the Product-Market-Technology validation principle will be explained in the next section.

### Five-Step AI-First SaaS Validation Framework

In this section, we will learn how to perform Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) validation of AI-first SaaS. The general steps of the framework are as follows:

1.  1\.

    Selecting the use case and industry

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Brainstorming ideas

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Measuring the feasibility

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Recruiting early adopters

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Validating Product-Market-Technology fit

    &#x20;

After performing the five-step framework, we can build an AI-first SaaS startup.

The whole framework is depicted in the graph in Figure [3-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="674" width="1424"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

The five-step validation framework is a method to validate the fit between the product, market, and technology for AI startups. This framework is based on my experience building over 20 B2B AI software and analyzing more than 30 successful AI startups. While not all steps need to be performed by AI startup founders, most will do some of the steps in the framework, eventually becoming patterns and best practices. By following this framework, AI startups can increase their chances of success by ensuring that their product fits the market and technology requirements.

#### Step 1: Choosing a Target Industry

The typical story of an AI startup is like this:

_The founder of the AI startup_ _is a_ _subject matter expert (SME)_ _in a particular industry with years of experience and insights into domain knowledge. They have an idea of automating inefficient, repeatable, and important tasks by transferring their knowledge and best practices gathered over decades into some form of artificial intelligence._

_The SME_ _can be specialist doctors, logistic experts, nutritionists, former general managers of hotel chains, former police officers, etc._

_This SME then finds a co-founder with AI expertise, someone very technical with years, even decades, of experience building data analytics–, machine learning–, or_ _operations research–based products. This AI expert often holds an academic credential such as MS or PhD in applied math, computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science._

_After a brief encounter, the SME_ _and AI expert have an idea to productize the knowledge of the SME into a scalable smart product to automate one particular process in the industry._

_In short: They want to build an AI-first SaaS._

The story after this can be different:

* Some AI startups will have good market traction and successfully go through an IPO process.
* Some AI startups don’t even have a customer, but the technology is so good and acquired by a bigger tech company with a good valuation.
* Some AI startups will have very good market traction and technology and be acquired with staggering valuations by tech giants.
* Some AI startups will fail to make it to market (this is actually the majority,[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3) but no one wants to talk about it, and no media wants to share it, so we rarely hear about it).

Whatever story will happen to your startup, it is important to remember that the first step to being successful in building an AI startup is that you need to **know yourself** (including your co-founder) and **choose the relevant target industry and domain with regard to your own experience, domain knowledge, and credentials**. Don’t waste your (and anybody else’s) time building an AI solution in an area where you are not the subject matter expert. AI is already complex enough to pull.

The starting point is to have an understanding of the strength of the SME and AI expert founders. They need to have

* _Functional expertise_: An experience in particular functions or positions, ideally at the managerial level.
* _Education_: A formal training in particular specializations. Ideally, an SME founder holds a bachelor’s degree in the relevant field of study. The AI expert must have relevant technical education related to AI with published works and/or patents.
* _Industry experience_: An experience in a particular industry, ideally more than five years.
* _Domain knowledge_: Deep knowledge about a particular field in their industry.
* _Networks_: A connection with people relevant to the target market, AI talents, and investment. The founders of AI startups need to have very strong networks in their target market. Due to the complexity of AI, where the talents are rare and expensive, it also helps that they have a network of technical talents.
* _Domicile_: Select the first place to start the AI venture where the target markets are abundant to test the solution and then go global.

The detailed steps:

1.  1\.

    Tabulate the founders’ education, functional expertise, industry experience, domain knowledge, and networks.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Mark the commonalities of industry and domain between SME and technical experts.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    The commonalities of industry and domain could indicate that it is an ideal place. Pick an industry and domain focus.

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: CHOOSE THE TARGET INDUSTRY

This is the fictional case study of AI startup entrepreneurs Sarah and Carlos, how they understand themselves and their strengths and weaknesses, and how they choose their target industry.

Sarah, a British national, has extensive experience in the hospitality industry, with an education in hospitality management and a general MBA. She has over 25 years of experience working in top hotels and resorts worldwide, starting as a hotel staff member and climbing up the ladder with the last position as a hotel general manager in one of the leading hotel chains in London. After a career spanning the Asia Pacific and Europe, she returned to the United Kingdom and has lived in London for the last five years. She knows many hotel owners in the United Kingdom.

She knows the hotel business and the operation ins and outs. She witnessed the inefficiencies and problems in this industry and thinks there is a more efficient and automated way of handling it.

She knew that AI could disrupt and change the landscape of the hotel industry, and she wanted to be part of it. She wants to build an AI startup that makes a little dent in the industry but cannot do it alone. She would need a co-founder with technical know-how, especially in AI and data-related fields.

Sarah met Carlos, a Brazilian data scientist working as a data scientist in an airline in London. Carlos holds a PhD in computer science with a thesis in data analytics for supply chain management from a university in Germany. Carlos has been working in the aviation, retail, and hotel sectors building data analytics systems.

After a brief discussion, they knew that they could make something together. Their expertise, experiences, and networks are tabulated in the following (Figure [3-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="879" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

From the preceding figure, we can infer that Sarah has adequate quality to be the subject matter expert in the industry, as she has hands-on functional expertise and domain knowledge related to customer service, logistics, and general management in the hotel industry. She also has a good network in hospitality and investment and a brother working at Microsoft Research.

Carlos has the quality of an AI expert. He has developed data analytics systems for the airline, retail, and hotel sectors.

His domain knowledge encompasses call centers, ITSM (IT service management), and supply chain management. He doesn’t have a strong network in the hospitality industry, but he has a solid network related to AI.

The commonalities (shaded in yellow) between Sarah and Carlos are both experienced in hospitalities, specifically the customer service domain. This is a potential industry and domain for them to explore. And the United Kingdom seems like the perfect place to start because it is the country with the number one hotel establishments in the world.[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4)

#### Step 2: Brainstorming Ideas

After you select the industry and domain focus, it is time to brainstorm ideas for AI solutions (Figure [3-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)).

CASE STUDY: BRAINSTORMING IDEAS

After a brief encounter, Sarah and Carlos decided to collect the industry analysis of the hospitality industry, including the current and future of the industry. They also managed to talk with their acquaintances in the industry.

Due to the pandemic and the proliferation of platforms such as Airbnb, they conclude that the hospitality industry in the future will be shaped around five important things:

1.  1\.

    _Health and safety_: Following the COVID pandemic, future consumers expect the hotel to provide them with better service related to safety, hygiene, and health procedures to get their trust and confidence.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Wellness_: Consumers are traveling to get new experiences. They expect better wellness facilities such as a gym, organic foods, self-care, medical facilities, etc.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Personalization and privacy_: Consumers expect a unique experience from the moment they book the hotel until they leave, without feeling that their privacy is violated.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Seamless and quick service_: The future consumers are digital natives. They expect the whole experience to be easy and fast. Automation is the key to this. Moreover, automation can potentially improve operational efficiency while reducing costs.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Cost-effectiveness_: The hotel consumer of the future expects better value for money.

    &#x20;

The health, safety, and wellness aspects are the main proposition of hotels compared with options such as Airbnb.

The five aspects mentioned here serve as the basis for future winning strategies for the hospitality industry to win over the customer of the future, which can be summarized as the following four factors:

1.  1\.

    **Personalizing** the experience of the consumers

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Enhancing **trust** by embracing better safety and health procedures

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Improving the **speed** of the services

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Giving more sensible **value for money**

    &#x20;

So there are four factors of the future winning strategies of the hospitality industry: personalization, trust, speed, and value for money.

Next, Sarah and Carlos analyze the value chain of the hospitality industry, which is their target market. These are what they do:

1.  1\.

    Map the core activities and sub-activities in the value chain and winning strategies.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Describe the inefficiencies in each activity and how they will hinder the winning strategies.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Ideate the AI opportunities – how AI helps overcome inefficiencies – along with the activities.

    &#x20;
4.  4.Measure how the AI opportunity will impact the potential **revenue** improvement, **cost** reduction, **legal risk** mitigation, and improvement of **customer satisfaction**. We note the impacts by color (see Figure [3-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)):

    1.  a.

        _Cyan_: No impact

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Yellow_: Medium impact

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Green_: Significant impact

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="761" width="1424"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-7 </p></figcaption></figure>

1.  5\.

    Focus on the AI solution ideas that potentially align with the winning strategy factors and have the highest impact on revenue, cost, legal risk, and customer satisfaction.

    Based on the preceding five steps, the winning strategy factors and revenue, cost, risk, and customer satisfaction impact are analyzed (Figure [3-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)). Sarah and Carlos conclude that there are two possible AI opportunities in hospitality customer services and sales:

    1.  a.

        _AI concierge SaaS_: Using face recognition and conversational artificial intelligence (chatbot) to check guests in/out, offer personalization and loyalty programs (upselling), order room service, and answer questions 24/7. This solution can also be connected with security and CCTV systems for 24/7 surveillance. This solution potentially impacts several strategic factors, such as personalization, service speed, and trust. This solution can also potentially impact revenue (by upselling and loyalty programs), save cost (by reducing the number of front offices and security guards), reduce risk (of theft and intruders), and increase customer satisfaction.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _AI hyperdynamic pricing and promotion SaaS_: Using AI to search social media automatically, news, and past customer data to predict travel trends and behavior of customers to display adaptive rates and promotions that maximize earning potential. The AI system can adjust prices and promotions to reflect the changes in demand. This solution can potentially impact strategic factors such as personalization and value for money for the customer. For the hospitality industry, this solution can potentially improve revenue. This is depicted in Figure [3-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8).

#### Step 3: Measuring Idea Feasibility

After we gathered the ideas from step 2, we will score them in a table and rank them. We will score them based on two important factors: business feasibility and technical feasibility. Our AI product idea feasibility uses four unique scores, each of which can be applied to any AI product idea. While the scoring criteria occasionally vary from startup to startup, the following scoring “rules of thumb” (all listed on a 1–4 scale) should serve as useful defaults for developing relative ratings for AI products.

In _business feasibility_, we must evaluate and score the ideas based on the following components:

* _Market size_: The potential market of our product
* _Usage frequency_: The frequency with which users interact with a given product or service
* _Market need_: The need for the product for the market along with their willingness to pay
* _Use case scalability_: Ease of applying the AI solution to different customers with minimum adjustment to AI models and business workflows
* _Competitiveness_: The number of competitors and the substitution in the industry

In _technology feasibility_, we must evaluate and score the ideas based on the following components:

* _The_ _expected level of autonomy_: The level of an AI solution refers to its ability to automate different aspects of a task, such as providing insights, making decisions, or taking action.
* _Risk of error_: The risk of error may happen (misclassification, misdetection, wrong forecasting, etc.). The error that occurred will impact the lives of others, whether it is reversible or not. For example, a false positive in a cancer screening test may lead to unnecessary and invasive follow-up procedures such as biopsies, causing physical discomfort and anxiety for the patient. On the other hand, a false negative in the same test may result in cancer going undetected, leading to delayed treatment and potentially worse outcomes for the patient.
* _Infrastructure_: The complexity of infrastructure is needed. We need to evaluate whether the AI model inference needs to be real time and whether the AI model tends to drift.
* _Algorithmic complexity_: The complexity of an AI algorithm is influenced by the dynamics of the environment it operates in. In highly dynamic environments, like those encountered by self-driving cars, the algorithm is more likely to face long-tail and adversarial problems. Complex algorithms are susceptible to encountering edge cases, which necessitate the implementation of a human in the loop (HITL) mechanism to ensure accuracy and reliability. This approach involves human oversight and intervention in the decision-making process when required, providing an additional layer of safety and control.
* _Data feasibility_: The feasibility of how data will be acquired and annotated consists of the following:
  * _Data generation frequency_: The frequency of data generation refers to how often new data is produced in a balanced manner across different categories. In certain use cases, obtaining new data for a specific class can be challenging, making it important to carefully manage the data collection process to ensure a well-rounded dataset.
  * _Annotation skillset_: The skillset of the annotators. Some annotations can be performed by everyone (including the user themselves); in other cases, they must be annotated by specialists/experts.

After we score and rank them, we select the idea with the highest score.

The output of this step is the AI product idea.

In practice, the feasibility scoring might look something like the simple chart in the following (Figure [3-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig9)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig9_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="704" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-9 </p></figcaption></figure>

We can assign weights to each component based on our goals and preferences. We can use multicriteria decision analysis methodologies, such as the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) or Analytic Network Process (ANP), to determine each component’s feasibility’s relative importance or weight. However, this book assumes that all components have equal relative importance for simplicity.

The detailed framework of how to score the feasibility of each idea by business and technology aspects is explained in the following.

**Business Feasibility: Market Size**

The first feasibility to measure is the market size of the product. We need to ask these questions:

* _What is the total market value for this AI product?_
* _Can we sell this AI product to the local, regional, national, or global market? If yes, when?_

We differentiate the market coverage to sell the AI product as follows:

* _Local market_: Particular city where the founders operate
* _Regional market_: Larger geographical areas such as districts, provinces, and states
* _National market_: A country level
* _Global market_: International level

Measuring the market size using TAM, SAM, and SOM models is important. TAM, SAM, and SOM are acronyms representing different market subsets:

1.  1\.

    _TAM_ – Total Addressable Market/Total Available Market: The total market demand for a product and/or services. TAM takes into account global and country-level market coverage.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _SAM_ – Serviceable Addressable Market or Served Available Market: The segment of TAM within the company’s geographical reach. SAM takes into account regional and national market coverage.

    &#x20;
3.  3._SOM_ – Serviceable Obtainable Market or Share of Market: This is the portion of SAM that can be realistically captured after considering other factors, such as

    * Competitor market share
    * Technology infrastructure readiness such as Internet coverage

    &#x20;

Steps to calculate TAM-SAM-SOM:

1.  1\.

    Identify the target market of your product.

    &#x20;
2.  2.Calculating TAM (Total Available Market):

    * Get primary research (survey, questionnaire, etc.) and/or secondary research (statistics from Statista, industry analysis, news).
    * Estimate the available customers in the whole country at least.

    &#x20;
3.  3.Calculating SAM (Serviceable Available Market):

    * Based on TAM, estimate the number of customers that are possible to reach. This can be on the local and regional levels.

    &#x20;
4.  4.Calculating SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):

    * Based on SAM, minus the share market of the competitors and other factors (i.e., Internet availability and others), estimate the number of customers that are possible to reach.

    &#x20;

SOM is the most realistic number. Therefore, we must score the relative market size based on SOM on the following scale:

* _1_: SOM < $10M
* _2_: SOM > $10M and < $60M
* _3_: SOM > $60M and < $100M
* _4_: SOM > $100M

For B2B AI-first SaaS, unless you live in a highly populated country like the United States, China, Indonesia, or India, it is important to ensure that the product can be marketed on a regional to global scale to get a good market size (above 100 million SOM).

**Business Feasibility: Usage Frequency**

For AI-first SaaS, it is also important to estimate the usage frequency of the product. The frequency users interact with the product tends to correlate with good business potential. Something that becomes a part of regular practice with a large swath of corporates has an opportunity to build a big business. The usage score can be estimated as follows:

* _1_ – One-time/scarce usage: An AI used only once every couple of years. An example is the AI solution to forecast the total recoverable oil reserve volumes, used only before an oil exploration project that happens once every several years.
* _2_ – Low-frequency usage: An AI solution used every few months. An example is an AI solution recommending the best place to open a new shop, which only happens once every several months.
* _3_ – Medium-frequency usage: An AI solution used every couple of weeks. An example is AI for evaluating tender documents, which is only used every few weeks when there is a new tender.
* _4_ – High-frequency usage: An AI solution is used several times daily. A biometrics-based eKYC solution for identity verification is an example of an AI solution used several times per day.

**Business Feasibility: Market Need**

Market need is a very important aspect of any product development.

These are questions we need to ask ourselves related to market needs:

* _Is this AI solution solving a customer problem by supporting, augmenting, or automating some of their tasks?_
* _How big is the problem for customers?_
* _Would they pay for this?_
* _Would they pre-order even before this product is available?_

For any AI product idea, score market needs on the following scale:

* _1_: Lowest evidence of market need (i.e., less than 10% of respondents liked the idea, let alone paying for it)
* _2_: Lower-middle evidence of market need (i.e., more than 50% of respondents said the idea is valid and worth paying for)
* _3_: Upper-middle evidence of market need (i.e., more than 80% of respondents said the idea is valid and worth paying for)
* _4_: Highest evidence of market need (i.e., more than 95% of respondents said the idea is valid and worth paying for)

Note that the 1–4 score is relative to the evidence of market need. This means that you will likely need to calibrate the market need of three to five AI product ideas before having a sense of what a “4” is and what a “1” is.

The relative market need can be estimated from several efforts:

* _Survey_: Questionnaire or questions directed toward a specific audience about the AI product idea. Services like Proved and MetaSurvey can help with a questionnaire and market validation.
* _Informal interview_: Interviewing several people in the industry over coffee or casual meetings/phone calls.
* _Landing and pre-order page test_: The AI product idea definition is written into the brochure and landing page with contact and pre-order form. We can measure the interest level of the potential customer by analyzing the number of visitors willing to share their contacts and even pre-order the solution. We can use landing page makers like Launchrock and Unbounce to quickly create a landing page and forms and perform A/B testing.
* _Crowdfunding_: A crowdfunding marketplace such as Kickstarter is a platform to raise money to finance a new product or venture. But this platform can also gauge interest in the product and make the community a part of the creation process. We can create a video and sales pitch of the product to attract the attention and interest of the backers who support the product from idea to launch.

**Business Feasibility: Use Case Scalability**

We must select an AI use case that can be scaled easily, meaning it can be deployed seamlessly to different customers with minimal changes and reconfiguration. The less scalable the use case, the more likely the business model will be into consulting instead of SaaS.

These are questions we need to ask ourselves related to use case scalability:

* _Can this AI solution be deployed to different customers without adjusting the AI models and workflow (configurable)?_
* _Can the customer adjust the AI models and workflow themselves without our involvement by just following documentation (easy to use)?_
* _Do we need an AI expert to customize the AI models and workflow for customers (adaptable)?_

Two aspects affect the AI use case scalability:

1.  1\.

    _Data variation_: The variation of the input data. Retail shelf image recognition is an example of an AI use case with high data variation. Every company must train different data. For example, cosmetics retailers will have a different dataset from liquor retailers. Consequently, we cannot have only one AI model to serve all the customers. We must have different AI models for different customers.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Workflow variation_: The workflow for a specific task, such as route optimization algorithms (vehicle route planning), can vary between companies. These variations are influenced by factors such as vehicle type, the presence of single or multiple depots, and constraints like visitation and goods restrictions. As a result, each company may have a unique workflow tailored to its specific needs and operational requirements.

    &#x20;

For any AI product idea, score the use case scalability as in the following:

* _1_ – high data variation and high workflow variation: An example use case is AI-based inverse design. AI-based inverse design is an AI optimization method of designing a new solution (materials, drugs, optical systems, etc.) by specifying the desired performance. The object to be designed differs from company to company, and the workflow is also different.
* _2_ – high data variation and low workflow variation: The example use case is retail shelf data recognition. The dataset of retail SKU (stock keeping unit) to be trained differs from company to company, with a relatively similar workflow.
* _3_ – low data variation and high workflow variation. The example use case is supply chain forecasting and optimization. The dataset used among customers is relatively similar, but every company has different workflows.
* _4_ – low data variation and low workflow variation: The example use case is fingerprint recognition. One fingerprint dataset can be used for different customers without too much workflow reconfiguration.

**Business Feasibility: Competitiveness**

We need to understand the competitive and substitution landscape of our AI solution. We ask the following questions:

* _Are there other companies (AI or not AI) satisfying the same customer need?_
* _Can a human do the tasks performed by AI with less cost?_

For any AI product idea, score the competitiveness on the following scale:

* _1_: Very competitive market regionally (more than 15 direct and indirect competitors, including humans)
* _2_: Competitive market (between 10 and 15 direct and indirect competitors, including humans)
* _3_: Medium competitive market (between five and ten direct and indirect competitors, including humans)
* _4_: Low competitive market (fewer than five direct and indirect competitors, including humans)

**Technical Feasibility: Expected Level of Autonomy**

The AI use case feasibility depends on the level of autonomy expected.

A fully autonomous AI system means that the AI can fully generate insight, decisions, and actions independently without human intervention.

We need to ask these questions:

* _Is AI augmenting humans or fully replacing humans?_
* _What do we expect AI to do for us autonomously?_

In the previous chapter, we learned that the AI system is ideally based on the OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) principle, which means we can expect AI to automatically provide us (see Figure [3-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig10)) with

* _Structured data_: AI transforms unstructured data into structured data autonomously. Examples are most computer vision applications such as vehicle counting, people counting, crowd detection, etc.
* _Insights_: An AI system that provides us with prediction and reasoning without our intervention. An example is a prediction of which machine will break down.
* _Decisions_: An AI system that decides for us. For example, an AI system gives us the most optimal production machinery allocation and schedule based on some insights, that is, RUL (Remaining Useful Life) prediction, demand forecast, etc.
* _Actions_: An AI system that acts for us. This AI system is the most complete and can provide insights and decisions. The example use case is the fully autonomous self-driving car.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig10_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="528" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-10 </p></figcaption></figure>

For any AI product idea, score the expected level of autonomy on the following scale:

* _1_: AI is expected to do an action autonomously (level 4 autonomy).
* _2_: AI is expected to decide autonomously (level 3 autonomy).
* _3_: AI is expected to give insights autonomously (level 2 autonomy).
* _4_: AI is expected to provide us with structured data autonomously (level 1 autonomy).

**Technical Feasibility: Risk of Error**

The risk of error refers to the potential negative outcomes resulting from an AI solution’s failure to accurately perform its task, such as making a prediction. The consequences of AI failure can range from minor, insignificant impacts to severe, life-threatening situations, depending on the application and context in which the AI system is used.

You need to ask these questions to assess the risk of error:

* _How big is the impact of the wrong automated or suggested decision resulting from our AI solution?_
* _Is the decision suggested or automated by AI reversible or not?_

A high-impact decision means that if the AI wrongly makes or suggests a decision, there will be financial loss or loss of life.

An irreversible decision means that once the decision is made, there is no return point.

Autonomous car AI is an example of an AI application that automates high-impact and irreversible decisions.

AI is best applied to automate reversible decisions.

For any AI product idea, score the risk of error on the following scale:

* _1_ – irreversible and high impact: An example is AI to predict whether a patient has cancer or not. Once the AI makes a mistake, then the consequence can be fatal.
* _2_ – irreversible and low impact: An example is AI to predict where and to whom to display ads. The decision to display ads to a particular person is not reversible, but the impact is relatively small.
* _3_ – reversible and high impact: An example is AI to recommend which stock to pick. Wrong AI recommendations can potentially result in financial loss, but stock price can change direction anytime; hence, it is reversible.
* _4_ – reversible and low impact: An example is AI to check and improve our grammar. It is reversible because humans can still check and edit it. Grammar mistakes also have a relatively low impact.

**Technical Feasibility: Algorithmic Complexity**

We must pick a use case for an AI solution where the algorithmic complexity is still sensible to be implemented and operationalized efficiently. There are two main challenging AI (especially machine learning) use cases:

* _Adversarial use case_: The use case where a deliberate attack to exploit the machine learning weakness is expected. An example is the face spoof detection system, where the spoofer tries their best to imitate legitimate face patterns to avoid being detected as spoof images.
* _Edge case–prone use case_: The use case where the possibility of an edge case is high. An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating condition. Usually, this happens because the machine learning system operates in a dynamic and unpredictable environment. An example is object detection for self-driving AI systems, where the edge case possibilities are high due to the dynamic environment on the road.

The more your AI use case tends to be adversarial and have a high risk of an edge case, the more complex your AI algorithm would be.

You need to ask these questions to assess the algorithm complexity:

* _Will any of the users deliberately trick the AI algorithm?_
* _Is the environment where the AI operates dynamic?_
* _Can we list all possible anomalies of data or behavior of the environment where the AI operates?_

When selecting a use case for AI implementation, choosing one with minimal conflicting interests and infrequent, complex situations is advisable. Conflicting interests refer to situations where multiple objectives or goals are competing against each other, making it challenging to achieve an optimal solution. This involves avoiding adversarial scenarios and edge cases that could make developing a reliable AI model difficult. To evaluate the algorithmic complexity of any AI product idea, consider using a scoring scale, such as the following one:

* _1_ – high edge cases and high adversity: An example is facial spoof detection to detect whether a selfie face is a live human or a spoof. The AI system must handle different spoofing attacks suck as a print attack (face printed on paper), replay attack (face recorded on video), and 3D mask attack. There are also many edge cases as there are almost limitless possibilities of how users will take selfie pictures (Figure [3-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig11)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig11_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="387" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-11 </p></figcaption></figure>

* _2_ – high edge cases and low adversity: An example is AI to detect objects on the road for autonomous driving. The road is very dynamic, and there are many unexpected objects on the road (see Figure [3-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig12)), but it is not a deliberate attack.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig12_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="707" width="1064"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-12 </p></figcaption></figure>

* _3_ – low edge cases and high adversity: An example is AI to predict email spam. The bad guys are deliberately finding a way to mimic legitimate emails. Still, there is no general edge case because the input is only text or numbers with limited length.
* _4_ – low edge cases and low adversity: An example is AI for recommendation systems. There are almost no edge cases and adversarial attacks for this use case.

**Technical Feasibility: Infrastructure Complexity**

Building an AI product is not only about algorithms but also about the infrastructure. AI infrastructure depends on memory, storage, security, and network requirements. Network requirements must be carefully planned, especially for embedded or edge devices. A well-designed infrastructure is crucial for successful AI implementation.

Infrastructure complexity depends on the expected inference speed and AI model consistency.

The expected inference speed refers to the anticipated amount of time it takes for an AI system to generate a prediction or decision. It is differentiated by

* _Batch inference_: The process of generating inference (predictions, recognition) on a batch of observations. The batch jobs are typically generated on some recurring schedule (i.e., hourly, daily, weekly).
* _Real-time/online inference_: The process of generating inference within milliseconds upon request.

Model consistency is the tendency of AI model performance to degrade due to _concept_ or _data drift_:

* _Concept drift_ is a type of _model drift_ where the properties of the dependent variable change. An example is creditworthiness scoring. The _creditworthy person_ two decades ago may be different from the _creditworthy person_ now. _Concept drift_ is prone to dynamic and seasonal use cases such as retail, ecommerce, finance, advertising, and marketing.
* _Data drift_ is a type of _model drift_ where the properties of the independent variable change. _Data drift_ includes changes in the data due to seasonality, a change in sensor sensitivity, etc.

We need to ask these questions to assess the infrastructure complexity of a particular use case:

* _How fast do we expect the AI to return the result to us?_
* _What factors are critical for AI infrastructure (memory, storage, security, and network)?_
* _How fast is the AI model degrades?_

Dealing with model drift and inference speed would be related to the infrastructure architecture. The faster the expected inference speed, the more we must prepare for the infrastructure to deal with a large amount of data in a very short timeframe.

The faster the AI model degrades, the more we must prepare the model reannotation, retraining, and redeployment infrastructure.

For any AI product idea, score the infrastructure complexity on the following scale:

* _1_ – real-time inference and low model consistency (high rate of concept and data drift): The example use case is fraud detection, where fraud must be notified and handled in seconds. Fraud detection is also prone to concept drift because the behavior of the fraudster changes quickly over time.
* _2_ – batch inference and low model consistency (high rate of concept and data drift): The example use case is sales lead forecasting. The inference can be performed in batches, but the model consistency is low because the behavior of the customers and market change rapidly due to seasonality and dynamic business conditions.
* _3_ – real-time inference and high model consistency (low rate of concept and data drift): The example use case is the license plate recognition system for the automated gates. The recognition must be performed in a split second, but the drift is unlikely because the license plate does not change visually overtime.
* _4_ – batch inference and high model consistency (low rate of concept and data drift): An example is a store visual merchandising analyzer based on visitor behavior. The inference can be performed in batches, and store visitor behavior (dwelling, trajectory) does not change quickly overtime.

**Technical Feasibility: Data Feasibility**

Data is the fuel for AI, especially the one based on machine learning systems. Therefore, it is crucial for the feasibility of the AI solution.

For most of the AI use cases based on supervised machine learning, data annotation skillset and data availability are very important aspects that will contribute to the data feasibility.

Data annotation skillset is the data annotation skillset needed to make sure that the AI model has valid and trusted labels. Certain use cases in machine learning may require experts to label the data, such as medical image data that requires specialist doctors to label it accurately. Similarly, plant disease data should be labeled by individuals with expertise in plant pathology, while those with expertise in marine biology should label data on the health of reefs. The involvement of domain experts in the data labeling process is important to ensure that the labeled data is accurate and reflects the nuances of the specific domain. This is particularly critical in medicine and environmental science domains, where mislabeling data can have serious consequences.

In some other use cases, even the user can annotate themselves in an _active learning_ mechanism, where the AI system can query the user in case of doubt (Figure [3-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig13)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig13_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1058" width="885"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-13 </p></figcaption></figure>

Data availability is how often new data is generated. Depending on the use cases, new data with different classes can be generated every hour, day, week, or even month.

To understand more about data feasibility, we need to ask these questions:

* _Do we need an expert to annotate the new data?_
* _Is the new data coming every hour, day, week, or month?_
* _Do we have abundant data for initial training?_
* _Do we need to create our dataset synthetically?_

For any AI product idea, score the data feasibility on the following scale:

* _1_ – low availability of data and needs a specialist to annotate: The example use case is rare cancer detection based on the medical image. We need a specialist doctor to annotate the image, and the new medical data is not easy to get.
* _2_ – low availability of data and the user or any layperson can annotate: The example use case is face spoofing detection. Anyone can easily differentiate between spoofed and real faces, but getting real spoof data is difficult because it is not common.
* _3_ – high availability of data and needs a specialist to annotate: The example use case is credit scoring, where the data is abundant but needs to be annotated by a trained credit analyst.
* _4_ – high availability of data and the user or any layperson can annotate: An example is vehicle counting. The data is abundant, and anyone can annotate.

CASE STUDY: MEASURING IDEA FEASIBILITYAfter Sarah and Carlos selected two ideas for the AI product:

1.  1\.

    AI concierge

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    AI hyperdynamic pricing

    &#x20;

it is time to estimate the feasibility. There are two important aspects of feasibility: business and technical feasibility. Estimating business feasibility is relatively trivial, and any entrepreneur or product manager worth their salt can do this without many difficulties, but estimating technical feasibility is quite challenging for a non-technical person. Still, we can use the OODA loop paradigm to simplify the process:

1.  1\.

    Break down the AI product idea into OODA loop phases: Observe-Orient-Decide-Act.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    In each OODA phase, determine the tasks that will be automated.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Describe all the AI models to enable automation in step 2.

    &#x20;
4.  4.Analyze the technical feasibility of all AI models in step 3 based on

    * Algorithmic complexity
    * Data availability
    * Infrastructure complexity
    * Risk of errors

    &#x20;

Let’s look at this example. The OODA loop and AI model design for AI concierge are as follows (Figure [3-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig14)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig14_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="484" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-14 </p></figcaption></figure>

The AI concierge solution will consist of three AI models:

* _Face recognition_: To verify and authenticate the guests based on facial biometric features
* _Conversational_: To have a meaningful conversation about reservation and services with the guest
* _Situational awareness_: To analyze the behavior and recognize unauthorized visitors

And here are the OODA loop and AI model design for AI hyperdynamic pricing (Figure [3-15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig15)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig15_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="484" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-15 </p></figcaption></figure>

The AI hyperdynamic pricing solution will consist of three AI models:

* _Social media insights_: To get insights about the latest travel trends and events from social media and news media
* _Travel analytics_: To predict the traveler’s behavior
* _Dynamic pricing_: To decide the best rate and promotion to offer to guests

Based on the AI models of each preceding AI idea, Sarah and Carlos estimate the technical feasibility of the AI concierge and AI hyperdynamic pricing solutions. They also estimate the business feasibility.

The following are the feasibility study scores of the two ideas based on the feasibility scoring framework explained (Figure [3-16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig16)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig16_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="759" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-16 </p></figcaption></figure>

As the AI concierge solution has a better feasibility score, Sarah and Carlos choose the AI concierge as the AI product they want to develop.

#### Step 4: Recruiting Early Adopters

After measuring the feasibility of and scoring the ideas, we get one idea for an AI product. The next step is to find and recruit early adopters willing to buy our AI solution (see Figure [3-17](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig17)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig17_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="180" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-17 </p></figcaption></figure>

We need to recruit and close the commercial deal with the early adopter for four reasons:

1.  1\.

    To validate the problem and its significance

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    To acquire datasets

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    To validate whether AI can solve the problem or not

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    To validate whether anyone is willing to pay for the AI solution

    &#x20;

The steps for recruiting early adopters are as follows:

1.  1\.

    We have identified an inefficiency in one activity in the value chain in a particular industry, and automated decision-making would solve the problem.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    We then define a buyer journey map to hypothesize how the buyers decide our AI solution is perfect for them.

    The goal is to understand how the product would be bought and decided, along with the buyer type. In this step, do not think about systematizing the buyer journey first. We need to think from the buyer’s perspective. The steps are as follows:

    1.  a.Determine three types of buyers:

        1.  i.

            _The_ _economic buyer (EB)_: This buyer is concerned with ROI. An example is the CFO, the finance manager, because they make financial decisions.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _The_ _user buyer (UB)_: Concerned with the user experience and day-to-day impact.

            &#x20;
        3.  iii.

            _The_ _technical buyer (TB)_: Concerned with security, interoperability, and robustness. An example is IT managers and developers.

            &#x20;

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Describe the buying journey from Need-Initial Awareness-Research-Comparison-Selection and Purchase-User Experience.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    We define the Lean AI product canvas (Figure [3-18](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig18)) to summarize the main idea of how our AI solution can solve the problem of our customers based on a different persona.

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig18_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="506" width="573"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-18 </p></figcaption></figure>

We can write the following elevator pitch based on this Lean AI product canvas and extend it to the landing page:

_For \[target customers] on the \[value chain] who are dissatisfied with inefficiencies of \[the current practice/staff/tool). Our product is a \[AI product] that can \[automate/augment] the \[thing that is inefficient or cumbersome]. Our product has \[benefits/outcome] for \[personas]._

Based on the clearer target customers, we can also build a list of early adopters and contact them through emails.

CASE STUDY: RECRUITING EARLY ADOPTERS

Sarah and Carlos decided that _AI concierge SaaS_ is an idea that has a good business and technical sensibility.

The next step is that they will define a buyer journey map to help them target potential early adopters.

They define three types of buyers and their motivations (see Table [3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 3-1&#x20;

Buyer Type and Their Motivation

| Buyer Type | Persona                                                                      | Motivation                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Economic   | <p>• Procurement manager</p><p>• Service manager</p><p>• General manager</p> | • ROI of AI concierge                                                                                                                                                  |
| User       | <p>• Guest</p><p>• Service manager</p><p>• Security</p>                      | <p>• Intuitive</p><p>• Quick onboarding</p><p>• Responsive</p>                                                                                                         |
| Technical  | <p>• IT manager</p><p>• Maintenance manager</p>                              | <p>• Easy to integrate with web cams and CCTVs</p><p>• Easy to integrate with the NFC door lock system</p><p>• Easy to integrate with the hotel reservation system</p> |

Based on the economic buyers, they brainstorm the buying journey of the AI concierge solution (Figure [3-19](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig19)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig19_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="729" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-19 </p></figcaption></figure>

After analyzing the buying journey and understanding the motivations of each type of buyer, Sarah and Carlos are now preparing a one-page Lean AI product canvas to summarize the value and persona of the AI product to be developed (AI concierge SaaS; see Figure [3-20](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig20)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig20_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1266" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-20 </p></figcaption></figure>

The Lean AI canvas is a strategic document that summarizes the problems that the AI solves for a particular persona by automating or augmenting some tasks. Then it describes the product elevator pitch as follows:

_For_ _**hotel service managers**_ _on the customer service who are dissatisfied with_ _**inefficiencies of the check-in process**_ _that must be_ _**through concierges**. Our product is an_ _**AI concierge**_ _that_ _**can automate check-in, checkout, room service, and lobby monitoring**. Our product can_ _**reduce costs for guest receptions and security**._

From here, Sarah and Carlos can write a website landing page and start copywriting that tests the AI concierge initial market (Figure [3-21](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig21)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig21_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="549" width="885"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-21 </p></figcaption></figure>

The next important step is Sarah, as someone with experience and networks in the hospitality industry, starts cold-calling her ex-colleagues and contacts to offer and sell them the idea.

She must list the potential early adopters and contact them individually to schedule a problem interview.

#### Step 5: Validating Product-Market-Technology Fit

The founder contacted a list of potential early adopters in the previous step. The next steps are

1.  1\.

    Conducting problem interviews with the early adopters to understand more about their problem.

    The problem interview will consist of several important topics:

    * _Business drivers_: The objects and metrics of the potential users.
    * _Problem_: The current tasks are costly, inefficient, and tedious.
    * _Decision-maker and user_: The decision-maker of the product who will decide on the product purchase and the user who will use the product.
    * _Business process_: The current process consists of multiple tasks that can be automated.
    * _Data_: The data required to accomplish the user’s specific tasks.
    * _Technology landscape_: The technology used in the industry is related to users’ tasks.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Building an AI Minimum Viable Product to solve the problem. We need to build a product with the Minimum Algorithmic Performancee (MAP) required by early adopters. The objective is to develop an algorithm that can be trained on a broader range of production data without overfitting while simultaneously satisfying the needs of early adopters in terms of performance metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. Additionally, the algorithm must be optimal in terms of _compute_ and _storage_ based on the specific requirements of the task at hand. By meeting these criteria, the algorithm will be better equipped to handle a wider range of data and produce more accurate and reliable results.

    &#x20;
3.  3.Conducting solution interviews by showing them how we can solve their problem using our AI solution and then asking them if they would pay for our solution and close the deal. These are the steps to do a solution interview:

    * _Categorize the prospects_: Economic, user, and technical buyers
    * _Verbalize the value_: Reducing cost, improving revenue, improving customer satisfaction, etc.
    * Showing the AI MVP
    * Estimating the timeline for when the product is ready for use
    * Stating the price of customizing the AI solution for the early adopters
    * Closing the deal

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    If we have several paying customers, we can start an _AI consulting service_ to get more use cases, data, and best practices and make it into a framework.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Validating Product-Market-Technology fit. When we have enough customers and use cases and can solve their problems using state-of-the-art AI algorithms and infrastructure, then we have Product-Market-Technology fit.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    Build an AI startup. We can productize our AI solution framework into Software as a Service, which can scale to a bigger market (Figure [3-22](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig22)).

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig22_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="131" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-22 </p></figcaption></figure>

CASE STUDY: VALIDATING PRODUCT-MARKET-TECHNOLOGY FIT

After Sarah and Carlos listed the potential early adopters and contacted them, several early adopters were interested in being interviewed by them. The early adopters come from diverse backgrounds related to hotel services, namely, customer service managers, security managers, and general managers.

They interview and prepare the following questions (Figure [3-23](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig23)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_3_Chapter/522265_1_En_3_Fig23_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1890" width="1308"><figcaption><p>Figure 3-23 </p></figcaption></figure>

After understanding the problems better and getting the data required from the early adopters, Carlos builds the AI MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the AI concierge, which can satisfy the users’ needs with minimum algorithmic performance.

Then they invite the early adopters to do solution interviews to see if their MVP is sufficiently valuable for their early adopters.

The most important thing is to ask the early adopters if they are willing to pay for the AI solution. If Sarah and Carlos get several paying early adopters, their AI solution market will be validated.

The next step to expand from this is to create an AI consulting firm that will custom-build AI concierge software for customers.

When they understand the market better and have enough paying customers, they can productize the consulting service by creating AI-first SaaS.

### Conclusion

AI-first SaaS is the next evolution of SaaS. The goal is AI-first SaaS is not only to make workflow efficient but also to augment human intelligence. With the technical complexity involved in AI product development, to increase the possibility of the AI startup being successful, we must analyze the business and technical feasibilities of the AI product thoroughly. Then we must find early adopters willing to work with us to improve the AI solution, providing us with the required data and direction. It is strongly advised that AI startups must start their journey from a service consulting firm to have a rich collection of data and possible edge cases that will be made into a solid solution framework.

Only after productizing our solution framework into software can we scale our AI solution as an AI-first SaaS.

### Key Takeaways

* AI-first SaaS can augment human intelligence. This is the main advantage of AI-first SaaS compared with the previous generation of SaaS.
* The main difference between AI-powered SaaS and AI-first SaaS is that the former only infuses intelligence into the workflow, while AI-first SaaS is built with AI at its core. This means AI-first SaaS cannot operate without AI.
* The main benefits of adopting AI-first SaaS for companies are improving efficiency and scalability. But it is also an important step toward becoming an AI-first company.
* AI as a Service (AIaaS) is another category of AI products. The main difference from AI-first SaaS is that AIaaS targets developers and data scientists, while AI-first SaaS targets end users.
* When building a SaaS product, it is crucial to target a specific market with a clear value proposition and to have a good understanding of the competitive landscape. One should not assume that the user will want to change their existing workflow and should seek feedback from users early on, especially from early adopters. Additionally, it is important to be a consultant first and foremost in order to truly understand the needs and pain points of the target market.
* AI is a deep tech product where the technical complexity needs to be validated against the business value. The Product-Market-Technology fit is crucial.
* The Product-Market-Technology fit validation to validate the AI product idea framework consists of five core steps:
  * Selecting the use case and industry
  * Brainstorming ideas
  * Measuring the feasibility
  * Recruiting early adopters
  * Validating Product-Market-Technology fit
