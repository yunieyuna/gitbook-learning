# 4. Product-Market Validation for AI as a Service (AIaaS)

The previous chapter taught us how to validate AI-first SaaS with the business user as the target market. In this chapter, we will learn more about AI as a Service (AIaaS), which targets the developers’ market, and how to validate its market.

Building AIaaS is a natural business expansion from AI-first SaaS. The main idea is to break down the AI models used in our AI-first SaaS, productize them, and sell them separately to developers as APIs or SDKs.

Building AIaaS is easier if we have to build AI-first SaaS first because we would use our AI models and tools daily and become familiar with them – as the saying goes, “eating our own dog food.”

Aside from AI models, we can also externalize our AI development platform and sell it to data scientists or developers to create and serve their own AI models.

Building and selling AIaaS enables us to have additional revenue and expand our markets.

### What Is AIaaS and a Developer-Centric Product

The cloud services such as SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS have been used effectively by enterprises. With as a Service models, we can shift to pay per use by subscription, which reduces spending and speeds up the implementation process. Artificial intelligence models such as machine learning, rule-based systems, and decision optimization can also be sold as a Service, or AIaaS (AI as a Service). AIaaS companies provide a cost-effective solution for businesses willing to use and invest in AI because AI as a Service providers maintain the AI infrastructure and model updates.

AIaaS is one of the business models specifically targeting the technical audience market, such as developers and data scientists, because the person who will implement and use AI solutions is the technical person. AIaaS can be categorized as a developer-centric product, meaning that the whole marketing strategy and experience design, from documentation to dashboard, must primarily satisfy the developer’s need.

#### Definition of AIaaS and B2D

AIaaS is short for Artificial Intelligence as a Service and refers to companies that offer off-the-shelf AI solutions from third-party vendors. Developing and maintaining AI is always costly and timely, and it needs a trained AI specialist with experience in AI operationalization, such as ModelOps and MLOps. Therefore, it is not a feasible option for many startups/companies. Developers can consume and integrate AI as an API, SDK, or development platform.

Due to its nature of augmenting intelligent features of a software product, the main target of AIaaS is developers and data scientists. Marketing to developers is referred to as B2D, or business to developer. The B2D or business-to-developer sector is a category that caters primarily to people who work with code (and data), software/hardware developers and data scientists specifically. In other words, those folks who spend their time writing programs for computers make up the main target audience. The main goal is to give developers more focus on the product they’re creating by providing them with ready-to-use tools and systems. So, in short, B2D companies build a product targeted to developers and software development companies (developer-centric products).

Some examples of a developer-centric product are

* _API_: The API (Application Programming Interface) is an easy-to-use, customer-friendly interface that allows the developer to integrate their software with other applications and hardware systems. Examples of APIs are Stripe (payment), QuikBlox (video chat), Elsa (speech recognition), and Wunderground (weather data).
* _SDK_: The Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools and programs used by developers to create applications for specific platforms. These include libraries, documentation, code samples, etc., all in one place. Examples of SDKs are FaceTec (liveness detection) and Identifai (KYC).
* _Software platform_: An end-to-end software tool to create and deploy a particular application. Examples are machine learning development platforms such as Amazon Sagemaker, Google Cloud Machine Learning, Azure Machine Learning, and IBM Watson and game development platforms such as Unity and Unreal.
* _Software tool_: A software tool that helps developers and data scientists in particular areas. Examples are Fiddler AI (machine learning monitoring), OctoML (machine learning deployment), and Stackify (performance monitoring).
* _Software framework_: Templates that provide the foundation for developing software applications. They use shared resources such as libraries and image files as one package and do everything many developers need simultaneously. Examples are Firebase ML Kit (machine learning for mobile), Rasa (conversational AI engine), and PyTorch (deep learning development).

#### Difference Between B2B and B2D

In the previous chapter, we discussed AI-first SaaS. The main target market is business (B2B model). The B2B model has the following characteristics:

* Selling directly to businesses as end customers.
* The direct buyers are
  * _Economic buyer_: CFO, COO, CEO, finance managers
  * _User buyer_: Operational end users
  * _Technical buyer_: IT managers, CTO, COO, VP Digital
* ROI is almost exclusively a deciding factor, followed by business value for the end users (consumers).

In contrast, the B2D model has the following characteristics (Figure [4-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)):

* Selling directly to product developers, who develop applications for businesses or consumers.
* The direct buyers are
  * _Economic buyer_: Product manager, CTO
  * _User buyer_: Developers, data scientists, testers
* Pricing, development time and cost reduction, and improving user engagements are the deciding factors.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="772" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

So the main differences between B2B and B2D products are as follows:

1.  1\.

    The B2B companies target decision-makers who are usually in the management level such as C-levels, VP, and managers, while the B2D companies target decision-makers who are usually at the technical level, such as developers and data scientists or product managers.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    For B2B, it is crucial to pitch the ROI and value of the products to end consumers, while for B2D it is more important to pitch the advantage of using the product (build vs. buy) to save development time and cost.

    &#x20;

As for the AI products, AI-first SaaS and AI-powered SaaS startups have a B2B model because they directly sell to businesses, while AIaaS startups have a B2D model because they sell to developers (see Figure [4-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="574" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Understanding a Developer-Oriented AI Product: API

As we have previously learned, there are several methods of delivering AI as a Service, but API is the most popular way of deploying an AI as a Service product because

1.  1\.

    It is simplest and fastest to be consumed by developers.

    &#x20;
2.  2.It is easy to monetize by the AIaaS companies.

    1.  a.

        _Pay per use_: Pay per API call.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Freemium API_: Free API for limited use, but pay to use a higher tier or other products like SDKs.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Subscription_: Consume API with a quota by subscribing per month or year.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3.There are many sales channels to sell API:

    1.  a.

        _Direct channel_: Sell the API via the website.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Sell the API via a marketplace such as Rapid API, AWS Marketplace, Rakuten, and Prompt API.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

These are the examples of AIaaS products with API delivery categorized by different AI methods (see Table [4-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 4-1&#x20;

Examples of API-Based AIaaS

| AI Methods                  | Example company                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Healthcare machine learning | <p>• Nubentos</p><p>• Infermedica</p>                              |
| Computer vision             | <p>• Valossa</p><p>• Identifai</p>                                 |
| Natural language processing | <p>• TextRazor</p><p>• Geneaa</p><p>• Linguakit</p><p>• Cogito</p> |

#### AIaaS Business Models

If we narrow the developer-centric product down only to AIaaS, there are two AIaaS fundamental business models, horizontal and vertical, as shown in Figure [4-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="761" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

1.  1._Horizontal business model_: The AI solution can be applied to multiple industry sectors and domains.

    1.  a.

        _AI Platform as Service_: This is an end-to-end Infrastructure and Platform as a Service to build and deploy AI models for various use cases and industry verticals. Examples are Amazon Sagemaker and IBM Watson.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Generic AI Tools as a Service_: A set of tools to help data scientists and engineers build, optimize, and deploy their AI models and datasets. Examples are Dataiku, DataRobot, H2O, Domino Data Lab, Modzy (model operationalization), OctoML (model deployment), Snorkel AI (dataset annotation), Scale AI (dataset annotation), and Super AI (dataset annotation).

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2._Vertical business model_: The AI solution is applied to a specific problem in a specific industry or domain.

    1.  a.

        _AI Model as a Service_: An AI model or algorithm packaged as API endpoints, SDKs, or containers. Examples are FaceTec (liveness detection deployed as API and SDK), OpenALPR (license plate recognition deployed as API and container), Trueface (face recognition model packaged as SDK and container), and PicPurify (porn and gun detection deployed as API).

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Specific AI Tools as a Service_: A set of tools to help data scientists and engineers build, optimize, and deploy their AI models and datasets for a particular industry. Examples are Routific (route optimization model building), Landing AI and Neurala (building manufacturing industrial inspection models), and Inbenta (building question-answer models for the banking industry).

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

Instead of building a horizontal end-to-end AI development platform or tooling, building an AI Model as a Service and eventually a vertical AI development tool that targets specific use cases in the industry vertical is better.

The reason is that building a horizontal platform or tooling that helps data scientists/AI engineers build generic AI models is challenging because of the following reasons:

1.  1\.

    Every AI use case is different. Building AI models for manufacturing has different challenges from building AI models for the healthcare industry and autonomous car companies. The data annotation method and AI model building and training methods are different. The deployment methods are also different. Any horizontal platform would need heavy reconfiguration and customization to handle new use cases.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Determining the target market segment is tricky. Many common complaints are that an end-to-end AI building platform is too complex for beginner and citizen developers but too restrictive for experienced technical persons. It doesn’t solve the problems for both user segments.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Even if you successfully build a generic horizontal end-to-end AI platform, you will compete with infrastructure giants who have already built this AI tooling platform on top of their infrastructure platform and can easily charge their AI tooling platform for a low price, even free.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    There is no dominant design of AI development tools yet. Novel AI development methods and paradigms are invented daily and published in prestigious conferences like _NeurIPS_, _ICML_, _ICLR_, _CVPR,_ and _ICCV_. The research is also publicly available as open source projects. So why must a customer pay for development tools that adopt obsolete methods when novel methods are already available for free?

    &#x20;

The best bet is to sell a combination of AI models and also a development tool to build and configure specific AI models. This will also depend on the use cases.

### Why Selling to Developers

With the rapid adoption of SaaS and public clouds, it’s clear that developers are driving innovation in enterprise software. The next trillion-dollar sector could be developer-driven.

Developers are at the center of today’s technology-driven world. They’ve become key players in the business, using their skills to build products that can be customized for any need or situation. Developers are not just other customers. They have the power to change an organization and its products, so companies need their needs met to succeed on this new level playing field that we call development nowadays. In this section, we will discuss further why the developer market is lucrative, the challenges, and how to win the hearts of the developers.

#### The Developer Market Is Lucrative

The developer market is lucrative because of the following reasons:

1.  1\.

    _Market size_: The potential size of the market is big. There are millions of developers in the United States alone. Developers are also working in SaaS and app companies serving millions of users.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Market validation_: Developers and their employers (SaaS and app companies) have an interesting problem to solve. In a digitally transformative, innovation-driven economy like now, companies are expected to build new technology to support their legacy systems as well as build new profitable business models. Developers are at the forefront of this war and must endlessly find the most efficient solutions to always be one step ahead of competitors. Cutting-edge technologies like machine learning can scale the business to another level, given that the developers can find the easiest way to apply and deploy them.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Influence_: Developers are the new star of the business. Technology has given developers the power to change industries. They are no longer just coding away at computer screens but shaping businesses from within by influencing their content and products with expertise that equals business influence. There are many benefits to getting developers on board with your product, including the opportunity for them or their clients’ companies to get funneled back into yours.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Technology validation_: As a technology company selling B2D products, you are selling something that solves your problem, and you believe that it would be useful for other developers. This _dogfooding_ mechanism can help B2D companies build much better relationships than B2B companies. B2D companies with good developer advocates can get their customers helping to find bugs and provide valuable technical feedback and feature development.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Word-of-mouth marketing_: Developers (including data scientists, testers, and software architects) are groups of people who hold highly particular values. The values of meritocracy, transparency, and sharing are very important for them. Developers want to work with companies that provide them with quality products. If you offer an honest, valuable service for developers, they’ll be happy enough to be your ambassador and boost word-of-mouth marketing.

    &#x20;

AIaaS companies can always benefit from building products for developers.

#### The Characteristics and Challenges of the Developer Market

Despite the attractive benefits of selling to the developers’ market or B2D, there are some characteristics of this market that we need to understand to be able to validate and sell the product successfully. It is helpful to use the familiar use cases in B2B and B2C as a baseline and compare them to B2D market models.

Most developer-centric markets (B2D) have characteristics that are uniquely different from the consumer-centric market (B2C), which has only one decision-maker, and from the business-centric market (B2B), which has several decision-makers. Actually, B2D contains some aspects of B2C and B2B.

B2D is similar to B2C in that

* Individual decision-making that leads to calls to action, such as self-service signups and credit card payments, takes priority over sales demos and contract negotiation.
* Inbound marketing strategies such as content marketing, social media marketing, community building, and partnerships are prioritized over inside sales and outbound marketing.
* Because the onboarding process is self-service and very low touch, it is easier to be data-driven in B2D.

But B2D is also similar to B2B in that

* The solution provided by the B2D company must first solve business problems. For example, the AIaaS product must automate some of the business processes.
* The buying decision-making process can still involve multiple stakeholders.
* Due to technical complexity, handholding and high-touch support are higher than in B2C, where support can be made more low touch.

In addition, the B2D market also has its own challenges, as follows:

* _DIY trait_: No matter how good your content, product, and relationship with the developers, developers are DIY (Do It Yourself) kind of persons. Their social status and pride are determined by the complexity of the code they develop with their own hands. This leads to the second point.
* _Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome_: The NIH syndrome is prevalent among developers in software companies. They feel that the best developer-centric product is the one they created themselves. This is also motivated by the proliferation of the open source movement, which enables tech companies to build their own proprietary tech stacks based on the open source frameworks.
* _Intellectual property_: Many tech companies feel that purchasing and using ready-made B2D products such as AIaaS hinders them from building core technology values, which can be part of their Intellectual property (IP). Building core technology values is indeed a very important part of a tech company. For example
  * An automated recruitment SaaS company most likely develops their own _emotional analytics_ engine as their core technology value.
  * The Salesforce automation SaaS company will develop its own _sales lead analytics_ engine.
  * Planogram plan SaaS companies will tend to develop their own retail _object recognition_ engine.
* _The paradox of selling tools to artisans_: Selling tools to artisans and builders such as developers is tricky:
  * If they cannot build the tool themselves, then it’s more likely that their knowledge level is low and continual handholding is unavoidable, which makes scaling the business almost impossible.
  * If they can build the tool themselves, they wouldn’t need our product. So we need to find the right market segment.

#### Key to a Successful Developer-Centric Product

To overcome some of the challenges of selling to developers, the following are the best practices from successful developer-centric companies. This applies to AIaaS as well:

1.  1\.

    _Friendly sandbox_: Provide a developer-friendly environment to play with your solutions. If the solution is AI development tools, the data scientists can build AI models on the sandbox. If the solution is an AI model, the developer can try the AI model by giving some inputs and receiving some outputs.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Clear collaterals_: Provide clear and instructive documentation, guidelines, and video tutorials to help the developers build the applications using your tools and/or AI models.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Build vs. buy business case_: Write a convincing time- and cost-saving ROI from adopting the solution.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Select a non-core, tedious, or complex use case_: Select a use case that is not a core value for most SaaS companies, which is usually a tedious one, for example, a payment service, or complex to develop, which needs quite deep and long R\&D, for example, AI development tools and computer vision models (face recognition, face liveness detection, speech recognition).

    &#x20;
5.  5._Build strong moats_: Your solution must have a strong technical moat such as follows:

    1.  a.

        Huge data was collected.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Efficient and scalable systems and processes.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Superior patented algorithms or AI models.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Customizable_: The developer solution must be easy to customize and configure by developers themselves with minimal handholding.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _Agnostic deployment_: The developer solution must be easy to deploy to multiple platforms (Web, edge devices, smartphones, bare-metal machines).

    &#x20;

#### The Mistakes of Developer-Centric Product Strategy

Understanding the challenges, there are several caveats when building developer-centric products. These are the common mistakes:

1.  1\.

    Targeting SaaS with a too niche market. B2D-oriented products like vertical AIaaS must target vertical SaaS with a large user base, for example, financial technology (FinTech) and marketing technology (MarTech), compared with SaaS in aviation, for example, with a small user base. After all, niches in SaaS usually have already developed their own core technology themselves because it is their main proposition.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    The product competes head-to-head with open source with a large community.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    The product is too complex to use for a developer with no easy interface.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Selecting the use case where the workflow and configuration variations are too high. The implication is potential handholding with developers and difficulty scaling. In this case, we must also sell the configurable tools and platform, which the user can adjust easily.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Selling a product that doesn’t have clear benefits and/or is too easy to develop by decent developers.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    The product does not deliver on the performance promised.

    &#x20;

### Five-Step AIaaS Validation

After building AI-first SaaS and selling it to the business users (B2B), we can further break down the AI models and platform to sell those to the developers (B2D) as well.

In this section, we will learn how to validate vertical AIaaS solutions, from assessing the maturity of the AI model, defining the vertical markets, defining the developer journey map, testing the market, and finally achieving Product-Market-Technology fit.

Suppose we can successfully validate and sell the vertical AIaaS (AI as a Service). In that case, we can also keep improving the maturity of the development platform and then, when the time comes, finally sell it as a vertical developer tool where the workflow and configuration, even the generation of new AI models, can be easily customized by the developer users (see Figure [4-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)).

The validation steps described here are also a good exercise for AI startup founders to retrospect and understand more about the technical and business feasibility of the current AI product and its extension to be developer-oriented (Figure [4-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1121" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1122" width="862"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Step 1: Breaking Down the AI Solution

Considering the main goal of AIaaS is to sell either the AI model or the AI tools, we first need to understand the maturity of our current AI models and tools to build those AI models (Figure [4-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)). For that, we need to break down all the models and tools to evaluate the variability inter-customer and then assess their maturity using a proprietary maturity assessment framework.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="724" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-6 </p></figcaption></figure>

Some AI models need to tackle different data characteristics from customer to customer. For example, for face liveness detection, the image data will be relatively similar from customer to customer (just facial images), so one API endpoint with one face liveness detection model can be used by several customers. On the other hand, the image data for retail SKU image recognition will differ from brand to brand (shown in Figure [4-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)), so multiple models must be trained and deployed for different customers.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="903" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-7 </p></figcaption></figure>

The implication of data varies from customer to customer because the data annotation and model training would differ for each customer. Therefore, the user must have the capability to train and configure their own AI model.

In addition to the variation of data characteristics from customer to customer, there is another challenge in the variation of logic, workflow, and rules of some AI models between customer and customer. Some AI models have a higher tendency to have different rules and logic compared with other AI models. An example is a Question and Answer (Q\&A) chatbot model. If we are using classical NLP algorithms and not Large Language Models, we can have a variety of rules and logic to be implemented for different use cases and different customers. The implication is we must also provide a tool for the users to modify and configure the Q\&A chatbot workflow and logic. To break down the AI models to be productized, we have to do the following steps:

1.  1.The first thing that we need to evaluate is the variability of the AI model deployed between customers, which is based on these two things:

    1.  a.

        _Data variability_: How the input data characteristics would be different from customer to customer

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Logic and rules variability_: How the rules and logic would be different from customer to customer.

        &#x20;

    Tabulate all the AI models to be productized and assess the variability of data and logic by using the following scale:

    1.  a.Data variability

        1.  i.

            _1 → low_: Few variations in data characteristics among customers.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _2 → medium_: There is significant variability in the data characteristics among customers.

            &#x20;
        3.  iii.

            _3 → high_: Every customer has different data characteristics.

            &#x20;

        &#x20;
    2.  b.Rules and logic variability

        1.  i.

            _1 → low_: Little variability of rules and logic among customers.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _2 → medium_: Significant variability of rules and logic among customers.

            &#x20;
        3.  iii.

            _3 → high_: Every customer has different rules and logic.

            &#x20;

        &#x20;

    We tabulate and score the data and logic and rules variability like the example in Table [4-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2).

    &#x20;

| AI Model                        | Input                         | Output                          | Data Variation per Customer | Rules and Logic Variation per Customer |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Face matching                   | Two faces                     | Matching score                  | 1                           | 1                                      |
| Planogram compliance            | Product images on shelf       | Compliance score                | 3                           | 2                                      |
| Route optimization              | Drop points and expected time | Optimal route with time windows | 2                           | 3                                      |
| Manufacturing defect inspection | Image of product              | Defect/Not Defect               | 3                           | 1                                      |

Then we determine inter-customer variability based on the following conditions (Table [4-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3)).Table 4-3&#x20;

Determining Inter-customer Variability of AI Models

| Inter-customer Variability | Condition                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Low**                    | If data and logic variability < 2       |
| **Medium**                 | If either data or logic variability > 2 |
| **High**                   | If both data and logic variability > 2  |

1.  2.After we understand the potential variability of each AI model, we then measure the maturity of the **AI models** by assessing the maturity of the process in each AI model development phase based on the following levels:

    1.  a.

        _Level 1 (Initial):_ The process in each stage is seen as unpredictable, inefficient, poorly controlled, and reactive.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Level 2 (Managed)_: Best practices and standard operating procedures have been managed but not written systematically in each stage.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Level 3 (Defined)_: Each stage has defined and written best practices and standard operating procedures.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        _Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed)_: Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and can be monitored manually.

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        _Level 5 (Automated):_ The process can be easily replicated, monitored, and automated with minimal human intervention.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  3.Measure the maturity of the **AI development tools** to create the AI models in all phases, from the data operations and training pipeline to serving, by the following levels:

    1.  a.

        _Level 1 (Basic)_: The tool is available but scattered with no standardized documentation or operational procedure.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Level 2 (Systemized)_: Standardized documentation and operational procedure are available, but the tools are still scattered with no integration between them.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Level 3 (Integrated)_: The tools are integrated with proper documentation and operational procedure.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        _Level 4 (Customizable)_: The tools can be easily configured and customized with a text-based command line.

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        _Level 5 (Externalizable)_: The tools have an easy-to-use and user-friendly UI that can be used by external developers or data scientists.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  4\.

    Using the following maturity templates (Figures [4-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8) and [4-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig9)), fill in the tool and AI model process maturity for each phase of AI development.

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig9_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="480" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-9 </p></figcaption></figure>

The maturity score of the end-to-end AI model process is then scaled as follows (max 40 points):

* _1 → low_: Process maturity score 1–10
* _2 → medium_: Process maturity score 11–20
* _3 → medium_: Process maturity score 21–30
* _4 → high_: Process maturity score > 31

The maturity score of the AI development tool is then scaled as follows (max 20 points):

* _1 → low_: Tool maturity score 1–5
* _2 → medium_: Tool maturity score 6–10
* _3 → medium_: Tool maturity score 11–15
* _4 → high_: Tool maturity score > 16

The maturity of AI models (in terms of process) and AI tools (in terms of systems) defines whether they can be marketed on a scale.

Select the AI models and AI tools that have the highest maturity level. The AI model with the highest maturity level is supposed to have an end-to-end automated process from data acquisition to how to explain the model result (XAIOps).

The AI tools with the highest maturity level are supposed to have an end-to-end system that external developers can easily configure.

As both the AI models and tools become more mature, we can eventually package and sell the AI models as API and SDK and development tools in one platform, so the customers can modify and configure the workflow, parameters, and performance of the AI models themselves. Some AI models with high levels of variability inter-customer must always include workflow and data configuration tools as a service.

Both maturities of AI models and AI tools determine the technical feasibility of AIaaS.

The AIaaS technical feasibility (see Table [4-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab4)) is assessed as follows.Table 4-4&#x20;

AIaaS Technical Feasibility Based on Process and System Maturity

| Process Maturity | System Maturity | Technical Feasibility |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Low-Medium       | Low             | Not feasible          |
| Low              | Medium-High     | Low feasibility       |
| Medium-High      | Medium-High     | Medium feasibility    |
| High             | High            | High feasibility      |

1.  5\.

    The last step is deciding whether to productize the AI model. The technical feasibility and AI model variability inter-customer determine (see Table [4-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5)) whether or not we shall productize and sell the AI Model as a Service.

    &#x20;

Table 4-5&#x20;

The Decision to Productize the AI Model or Not Is Based on Variability Inter-customer and Technical Feasibility

| Variability | Technical Feasibility | Productize/Not |
| ----------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Low         | Low                   | Go with notes  |
| Low-Medium  | Medium-High           | Go             |
| Medium-High | Low                   | Stop           |
| High        | Medium-High           | Go             |

From the preceding table, we can infer that when the technical feasibility of the AI model is low and variability between customers is high, then we cannot productize it. When the technical feasibility of the AI model is low and variability between customers is low, we can still productize it with notes that the maturity (process and system) must be improved along the way.

CASE STUDY: BREAKING DOWN THE AI SOLUTION

Sarah and Carlos have been quite successful with their AI concierge SaaS. Inspired by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) successful story, where they sold their internal tools to the public in 2006[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1) as a side business, but it turned out to be a quite successful business that contributed significant revenue, Sarah and Carlos are interested in selling the AI models and the tools they have developed for the AI concierge SaaS.

First, they are breaking down the AI models used in their AI-first SaaS:

* _Face verification and recognition model_: A computer vision deep learning model to verify faces (1:1 face matching) and recognize a face (1:N face matching)
* _Customer service QA model_: NLP question-answering deep learning model
* _Situational awareness model_: A computer vision deep learning model to recognize suspicious behavior and intruders

Then they are scoring the variability inter-customer for every AI model as follows (Table [4-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab6)).Table 4-6&#x20;

Variability Inter-customer for the AI Concierge Models

| AI Model                  | Input            | Output                        | Data Variation per Customer | Rules and Logic Variation per Customer | <p>Variability</p><p>Inter-customer</p> |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1:1 face matching         | Two faces        | Matching score                | 1                           | 1                                      | Low                                     |
| 1:N face matching         | Face vs. N faces | Nth similar face              | 1                           | 1                                      | Low                                     |
| Customer service QA model | Queries          | Answers                       | 3                           | 3                                      | High                                    |
| Situational awareness     | CCTV frames      | Potential intruders and crime | 2                           | 2                                      | High                                    |

Based on the preceding table, Sarah and Carlos infer that the face matching model can be productized merely as an API, while the customer service QA and situational awareness models can only be productized if the model and workflow can be configured due to higher expected variability between customers.

The next step is they need to score the process maturities of the AI models in each operational phase with the following colored table (Table [4-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab7)).Table 4-7&#x20;

Process Maturities of AI Concierge Models

![](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Figa\_HTML.png)From the preceding table, the process maturity scale for each AI model is

* _Face recognition_: 3 → medium
* _Customer service QA_: 3 → medium
* _Situational awareness_: 2 → medium

Second, they must also break down the tools used to develop the AI models and score their system maturities. The result is tabulated in the following table (Table [4-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab8)).Table 4-8&#x20;

AI Tool/System Maturity of the AI Concierge SaaS

| Component              | <p>Maturity Level</p><p>(1–5)</p> |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Dataset operations** | 3                                 |
| **Model development**  | 4                                 |
| **Logic pipeline**     | 4                                 |
| **Model serving**      | 4                                 |
| **Total**              | 17                                |

From the preceding table, the tool maturity scale is **High**. This means that the tool used to do data operations, model plus logic development, and deployment for the AI concierge is highly configurable and can easily be used by external users.

The next step is Sarah and Carlos must assess the technical feasibility for all AI model candidates to be productized based on their process and system maturities using the template in Table [4-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab9).Table 4-9&#x20;

Technical Feasibility of AI Models for the AI Concierge SaaS

| AI Models                 | Process Maturity | System Maturity | Technical Feasibility  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Face recognition**      | Medium           | High            | **Medium feasibility** |
| **Customer service QA**   | Medium           | High            | **Medium feasibility** |
| **Situational awareness** | Medium           | High            | **Medium feasibility** |

We can see that all the AI models have medium technical feasibility. The last step is to assess which AI models are suitable for the variability between potential customers based on the template in Table [4-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab10).Table 4-10&#x20;

Technical Feasibility vs. Variability for Each AI Model

| AI Model              | Variability | Technical Feasibility | Productize/Not |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| Face recognition      | Low         | Medium                | Go             |
| Customer service QA   | High        | Medium                | Go             |
| Situational awareness | High        | Medium                | Go             |

Based on the preceding table, Sarah and Carlos are confident that their AI system and process can handle various variability for different customer use cases. Next, the commercial aspect will also be assessed after the technical aspects are considered.

#### Step 2: Defining the Vertical Market

The next step is to analyze the market to sell the AI models. We must define potential use cases in different verticals that will potentially adopt the AI models and/or tools. The steps are as follows:

1.  1.Define potential use cases that will adopt the AIaaS. We must analyze the SaaS landscape in different verticals and see where AIaaS can be adopted. The potential use cases are then scaled as follows:

    * _4_: > 4 use cases in more than three industry verticals.
    * _3_: < 4 use cases in more than three industry verticals.
    * _2_: > 4 use cases in less than three industry verticals.
    * _1_: < 4 use cases in less than three verticals.

    &#x20;
2.  2.Assess the competition. Our main competition in the AIaaS space is direct competitors and also the in-house development team. The peril of selling to technical people like developers is that if the solution is easy for them to build, they will build it themselves unless there are significant complexity and obstacles. The development team will tend to build the AI solution in-house if the following conditions are met:

    1.  a.

        There is a considerable number of public datasets available.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        The annotation does not need to be performed by subject matter experts.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Many research papers, blogs, and other references explain how to build the AI model.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        The complexity of the model’s architecture is relatively low if the input is structured data (transaction records, Excel tables, SQL). Unstructured data (images, videos, tweets, texts) is more complex than structured data.

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        Compared with streaming data, the infrastructure needed to build and run the AI model is considerably light (non-streaming data).

        &#x20;

    We score the risk of the AI solution that has a tendency to be built in-house as follows (Table [4-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab11)).

    &#x20;

* A score above 3 means that the AI solution is most likely to be developed in-house.
* A score between 0 and 3 means that the AI solution is less likely to be developed in-house due to the resource needed.

Table 4-11&#x20;

In-House AI Model Build vs. Buy Scoring

| **Criteria**                                   |                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Datasets available publicly (+1).              | Most datasets are proprietary (+0).                  |
| Lots of references (+1).                       | Few references (+0).                                 |
| Many open source AI models are available (+1). | Only a few open source AI models are available (+0). |
| Structured data (+1).                          | Unstructured data (+0).                              |
| Non-streaming data (+1).                       | Streaming data (+0).                                 |
| Anyone can label (+1).                         | Only an expert/SME can label (+0).                   |

For the AIaaS product idea, scale the competitiveness on the following scale:

* _1_: > 4 direct competitors and mostly to be developed in-house.
* _2_: > 4 direct competitors and less likely to be developed in-house.
* _3_: < 4 direct competitors and most likely to be developed in-house.
* _4_: < 4 direct competitors and less likely to be developed in-house.

1.  3\.

    We then tabulate the scores of competition and business potential.

    &#x20;
2.  4\.

    Based on the scores, we select the AIaaS product to sell.

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: DEFINE THE VERTICAL MARKETAfter analyzing the maturity of the AI models and tools, Sarah and Carlos then analyze the potential vertical market for the AI models and/or tools.

1.  1\.

    They define the AI models’ potential uses cases and industry verticals that can be targeted (Table [4-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab12)).

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Then they define the competitiveness of the AI models. First, they assess the tendency of the AI model to be developed in-house or not (see Table [4-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab13)).

Then they assess the competitiveness scale: direct competitors who already sell similar AIaaS plus the in-house development tendency (Table [4-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab14)).Table 4-14&#x20;

The Competitiveness Scale

| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- |
| Face recognition      | 6                     | Yes                           | 1     |
| Service QA            | 5                     | No                            | 4     |

1.  3\.

    The last step is to tabulate the maturity, business potential, and competitiveness of each AI model (Table [4-15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab15)).

    &#x20;

The Total Score of System/Process Maturity, Business Potential, and Competitiveness of AI Models

| AI Models             | Business Potential Score | Competitiveness Score | Total Score |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Face recognition      | 3                        | 1                     | 4           |
| Service QA            | 1                        | 4                     | 5           |
| Situational awareness | 1                        | 5                     | 6           |

Based on the preceding scores, Sarah and Carlos decide that their situational awareness model has the best potential to be commercialized. The next step they will do is to define the journey map and proposition.

#### Step 3: Mapping the Developer Buying Journey

This step will define the developer buying journey and lean canvas for AIaaS. This step aims to define the growth strategy based on the proposition offered by this AIaaS.

The steps are as follows:

1.  1\.

    Define the developer buying journey map.

    The developer buying journey map is the process that the product managers, developers, and data scientists go through on the way toward buying developer products, such as API, SDK, and development tools. The goal of building the buying journey map is to better understand our customer’s experience and expectations so that we can define proper propositions and marketing strategies for our developer product (see Figure [4-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig10)).

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig10_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="727" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-10 </p></figcaption></figure>

In the developer buying journey map, we must define

* _Who_: The actors or the persons that will buy our AIaaS product.
* _Goals/needs_: The goals and needs of the actors in every stage.
* _Questions_: What questions do they have in mind at every stage.
* _Activities_: What our actors think and do at every stage.
* _Internal touch point_: The properties and content that your company owns and controls. Examples are the company website, developer hub, documentation, social media, public code repository, etc.
* _External touch point_: The properties and content that your company does not have direct control of, but they are the channels to reach existing users and potential customers. Examples are Stack Overflow, Product Hunt, developer events and hackathons, online tech blogs, and online tech magazines.

The good thing if you already have an AI SaaS is that your product manager and your developer can be your valuable persons to get insights and feedback about their pains in finding ready-made AI solutions.

1.  2\.

    Define the lean AIaaS canvas. After we understand the pain points and the needs of the potential customers, we put the AIaaS idea into perspective and a guide to validate our hypothesis. We fill the following lean AIaaS canvas (Figure [4-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig11)).

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig11_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1299" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-11 </p></figcaption></figure>

The AIaaS lean canvas consists of the following components:

* _SaaS/app target market_: SaaS or application that can leverage our AI model. We are targeting the developers and product managers of this particular SaaS or application.
* _End user_: The target market of this SaaS or application.
* _Use case_: The use cases where the AI model can be applied.
* _Industry_: The industries where the AI model can be useful.
* _AI model input and output_: What data is given as an input and what is resulted as an output.
* _Model deployment_: How the AI model is going to be deployed, whether it is via API, edge device, or SDK.
* _Current tool/practice_: How the current SaaS performs the task manually.
* _Benefits for users_: The benefits of the AIaaS for the developers and end users.
* _AIaaS summary_: The summary of the AIaaS solution we provide to the customers.

1.  3.Based on the previous lean AIaaS canvas, we write down the elevator pitch for our AIaaS solution in the following format:

    * _For_ _**\[SaaS and application providers]**_ _who want to add proposition such as_ _**\[proposition for the SaaS]**. Our product is a_ _**\[name of AI model or tool as a service]**_ _that provides_ _**\[what AI model or tool does]**. Unlike_ _**\[the conventional method/practice]**, our AIaaS enables_ _**\[value and functionality of AI model/tool]**_ _that can be consumed by_ _**\[end users]**_ _industries and enable them to_ _**\[benefits for end users]**._

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: MAPPING THE DEVELOPER BUYING JOURNEYSarah and Carlos have chosen the situational awareness AI model to be productized as a service. Next, they must map the developer buying journey, define the lean AIaaS canvas, and write the elevator pitch (see Figures [4-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig12) and [4-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig13) for the Learn, Build, and Call to action stages of the developer buying journey).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig12_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1623" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-12 </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig13_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1314" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-13 </p></figcaption></figure>

Sarah and Carlos perform buying journey mapping of situational awareness AI as a Service in whiteboards with post notes or a collaborative whiteboarding software like Miro.

The next step is for Sarah and Carlos to write down an AIaaS canvas to reiterate the value proposition of their product (Figure [4-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_4\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig14)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_4_Chapter/522265_1_En_4_Fig14_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1223" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 4-14 </p></figcaption></figure>

Based on the preceding lean AI canvas, Sarah and Carlos then write down the following elevator pitch:

_For_ _**\[surveillance SaaS and NVR providers]**_ _who want to add proposition such as_ _**\[intruder detection, blacklisting]**. Our product is a_ _**\[situational awareness engine]**_ _that provides_ _**\[AI models related to intrusion detection]**. Unlike_ _**\[the usual motion detection feature]**, our AIaaS enables_ _**\[automatic intruder monitoring]**_ _that can be consumed by_ _**\[building management, hospital, and hospitality]**_ _industries with the benefits of_ _**\[reducing the cost of security staff and reducing criminal risk]**._

#### Step 4: Testing the Market

Here we define the AIaaS market demand and growth strategy even before we build the product completely. We must define the go-to-market (GTM) strategy that can validate the AIaaS needs and demands by creating the following checklists:

* Preparing a landing page with content about possible use cases of the AI model
* Showing sample codes or user interfaces for the developers to show how easy and seamless it is to use the AI models and/or tools
* Preparing a _call-to-action_ page with trial pages for a development sandbox

CASE STUDY: TESTING THE MARKET

After Sarah and Carlos made a clear proposition defined in the AI lean canvas and elevator pitch, Carlos and his technical team set up the situational awareness AI model and configuration tool to be deployed on the Docker container and then deployed on the public cloud as a development sandbox to be accessed by developers from their website. Carlos is also preparing _to start the guide_ and documentation.

Sarah and Carlos then prepare a website with a landing page.

They put the following on their landing page:

1.  1\.

    The narration of why intrusion and suspicious behavior detection is important for industries such as building management and hospitalities

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    The benefit of using the situational awareness AI engine for surveillance/visitor management system SaaS developers, NVR application developers, and CCTV manufacturers

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Link to the developer sandbox where the developers can try the situational awareness AI engine for free during a trial period with limited features

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Call-to-action page with contact forms and a pre-subscribe page where the developers can pre-pay the situational awareness AI model for the full features during some subscription period

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Analytics tool to analyze the behavior of the users (developers) while tinkering with the sandbox and reading the documentation

    &#x20;

#### Step 5: Validating Product-Market-Technology Fit

In this last step, when we have lots of traction from developers, as indicated in the following

1.  1\.

    Many developers are trying our AI as a Service models and/or tools in the sandbox.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Many developers are pre-subscribing to our AI models and configuration tools.

    &#x20;

we can finally say that we have validated the product, market, and technology.

For the developer market, the market validation from building an MVP of the development sandbox is much more effective than testing it with surveys, FGD (focus group discussion), and interviews. We can analyze how they interact with the AI models, how they integrate them, and how they read the documentation and developer guides provided. If we have a steady growth of new users pre-subscription (i.e., 10% monthly), we have validated the AIaaS market.

As we have more users, we must scale the system with more features, better operationalization (DevOps and MLOps) and infrastructure capacities, and a better user interface (Chapter [7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_7\_Chapter.xhtml)). We must also build better user management, API management, payment, and subscription systems. Also, expand the deployment models to other platforms such as Android and edge devices.

As we scale out the system, we can also scale up the go-to-market strategy by building a partnership program (which will be discussed in Chapter [9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml)).

CASE STUDY: VALIDATING PRODUCT-MARKET-TECHNOLOGY FIT

After launching the situational awareness AIaaS landing page and developer sandbox, there are sufficient insights on how developers use and integrate the AI model with their applications. Sarah and Carlos then analyze the usage data to determine whether or not the market for this particular AI model is validated.

They see that the usage growth is significant, plus some developers decide to pre-subscribe to their AIaaS.

The growth of developers pre-subscribing to their AIaaS is 10% monthly. They conclude that the Product-Market-Technology fit has been met, so they decide to scale up the MVP to full-scale development and operationalization.

They are also preparing a more thorough and scalable go-to-market strategy with a partnership program.

### Conclusion

Selling to a developer in the business-to-developer (B2D) market is quite a new business model and can be very lucrative if we can select the right product and market. AI as a Service (AIaaS) is selling AI models or AI development tools for the developer as a user and a part of the B2D business model.

Building AIaaS is an interesting endeavor if we already have AI-first SaaS. We need to break down the AI models and tools to develop the AI models in the first place and productize and sell them. But to select which AI models to productize is quite complex. We need to measure the technical and business feasibility first and then validate the product, technology, and market.

### Key Takeaways

* Developers in today’s world are key players who have the power to change an organization and its products.
* The B2D or business to developer is a business model in which the product is consumed by technical people who develop software.
* Developer-centric products include API (Application Programming Interface), SDK (Software Development Kit), software platform, software tool, and software framework.
* Developing and maintaining AI is a costly process that can be difficult for many startups or companies.
* AIaaS (AI as a Service) is a business model that explicitly targets the technical audience, such as developers and data scientists. The people who will implement and use AI solutions are typically technical.
* AIaaS is part of the B2D (business-to-developer) business model.
* The B2B model is when the buyer of a company sells to another company’s buyers. ROI and value for end users are the largest deciding factors in this model.
* The B2D model features fast and efficient development plus less development cost.
* B2B targets strategic decision-makers, and B2D targets technical decision-makers.
* The most popular form of AI service is API because it is simple, easy to monetize, and quick for developers to make use of.
* AIaaS, or AI as a Service, is divided into horizontal and vertical models.
* The horizontal business model can be applied to multiple sectors and use cases, while the vertical business model applies only to one sector and/or use case.
* Instead of building a horizontal end-to-end AI development platform or tooling, it’s better to build an AI Model as a Service and, eventually, a vertical AI development tool that targets specific use cases in the industry vertical.
* Selling to a developer is also challenging because developers like to develop everything by themselves.
* The key to successful B2D products is as follows:
  * Friendly sandbox
  * Clear collaterals
  * ROI-oriented business case
  * Selecting a non-core, tedious, or complex use case
  * Building strong moats
  * Customizable
  * Agnostic deployment
* Mistakes of B2D are as follows:
  * Targeting SaaS with a too niche market.
  * Competes head-to-head with open source with a large community.
  * The product is too complex to use for the developer.
  * Selecting the use case where the workflow and configuration variations are too high.
  * Selling a product that doesn’t have clear benefits.
  * The product does not deliver on the performance promised.
* The five steps of AIaaS validation are

1.  1\.

    Assessing the technical feasibility by breaking down AI solutions into AI models and development tools to develop the AI models and evaluate their maturity

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Assessing the business feasibility by assessing competition and potential

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Mapping the developer buying journey and value proposition

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Validating the market by building a landing page and developer sandbox

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Validating the Product-Market-Technology fit by analyzing the traction
