# 10. AI Startup Exit Strategy

As discussed in the previous chapters, building a successful AI startup is no easy feat. It requires a deep understanding of complex technology, its operationalization, a sound business model, and the ability to navigate complex market dynamics. But once a startup has gained traction and is on the path to success, the founders need to start thinking about their exit strategy.

This chapter will explore the various exit options available to AI startups and why founders must plan their exit in advance. We will also discuss why companies seek to acquire AI startups and the factors that impact their acquisition decisions.

Furthermore, we will provide practical advice for AI startup founders on identifying potential acquirers, evaluating their strategic value, navigating the due diligence process, negotiating a fair deal, and transferring ownership. Clear communication with customers and partners throughout the exit process is also essential, and we will discuss strategies for managing those relationships.

Using case studies, we will provide a real-world example of AI startups that have successfully exited and share the lessons learned along the way. By the end of this chapter, you will better understand the exit options available to AI startups, the factors that influence acquisition decisions, and how to prepare for a successful exit.

### Introduction

The demand for AI solutions is increasing rapidly, resulting in the emergence of new AI companies.

By 2030, the global AI market is projected to contribute US $15.7 trillion to the global market, presenting a significant opportunity for businesses to drive innovation and create value.

AI adoption enables businesses to automate routine tasks, increase productivity, and make accurate predictions and recommendations in all industry sectors.

However, the potential benefits of AI must be balanced with the risks and challenges associated with bias, privacy violations, and employment impact. Despite these challenges, many companies, from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to startups like Nodeflux, Aire, AlphaSense, and Formation AI, are investing heavily in AI research and development to remain competitive in the market.

In addition to the examples of emerging AI startups, generative AI is also taking the world by storm. ChatGPT, Midjourney, and DALL-E are notable examples of generative AI startups gaining industry attention. ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI, has been widely adopted for text generation tasks such as writing, customer service, and content creation. Midjourney’s generative AI platform offers various services, including voice cloning and audio production, while DALL-E, also developed by OpenAI, generates images from textual descriptions. These examples demonstrate the growing influence of generative AI on various industries and highlight the potential for further innovation and disruption in the future.

This chapter discusses the exit options for AI startups, including acquisition and merger, and how to achieve a successful exit. We examine the strategic acquirer for AI companies, which could be any company interested in acquiring the AI company for strategic reasons aligned with their business goals. Furthermore, we provide strategies for increasing the likelihood of a positive outcome, drawing on case studies benchmarking 58 AI companies worldwide.

#### The Gold Rush of AI

The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by businesses has led to a surge in the acquisition of AI startups. AI startups are considered attractive acquisition prospects, particularly after the pandemic, as companies seek to benefit from AI and machine learning technologies. Major corporations such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have invested billions of dollars in AI companies across every industry and business function imaginable. This gold rush of AI is driven by the potential for productivity gains and cost savings, with companies rushing to capitalize on AI’s benefits before their competitors. China and the European Union have also made significant investments in AI, reflecting the global importance of this technology.

Numerous AI firms have been acquired for different reasons. For example, Microsoft acquired Nuance, an AI-based technology company that provides speech recognition and voice transcription services, for $19.7 billion.

Facebook acquired Scape Technologies, a computer vision firm that uses AI to build a real-time 3D globe map using conventional pictures and videos, for $40 million. IBM acquired Turbonomic, an AI-powered Software Resource Management startup, to improve performance and save costs through AIOps.

Apple acquired Xnor.ai, a Seattle-based business focusing on the optimal application of AI in peripheral devices such as cell phones and drones. For $200 million, IBM acquired Databand.ai to enhance the trustworthiness of their AI products.

These acquisitions are designed to integrate AI technology further into core platforms and advance AI application development.

#### Exit Strategies of AI Startups

AI startups have different exit strategies that they can pursue to cash in their investments and efforts. One of the most common exit strategies is an initial public offering (IPO). However, this is rare for AI startups as it requires significant financial resources, a well-established track record, and a stable business model. Examples of AI startups that have successfully gone public include Darktrace, Babylon, and SentinelOne.

Another exit strategy for AI startups is an acquisition by larger companies. This has become a popular option, allowing AI startups to take advantage of the acquiring company’s resources, network, and market presence. Examples of successful acquisitions of AI startups include AI.Reverie acquired by Facebook, VisionFactory by Google, Emotient by Apple, and Semantic Machines by Microsoft.

The acquisition is often the best option for AI startups because AI technologies are constantly evolving and becoming obsolete rapidly. Being acquired by a larger company provides the startup with access to the resources necessary to keep up with the latest advancements and stay competitive.

On the other hand, acquiring an AI startup also has several advantages for the acquirers. Firstly, it allows the acquirer to quickly access new technologies, expertise, and talent that can enhance their existing product offerings or help them enter new markets. This access to new technology and expertise can give the acquirer a competitive advantage over their rivals by assisting them to stay ahead of the curve in innovation and cutting-edge technology. Additionally, acquiring an AI startup can be a faster and more cost-effective way for a company to gain access to new AI technology or expertise compared with developing these capabilities in-house. Moreover, it can help mitigate risk by reducing the time and cost associated with developing new technology or capabilities in-house and by providing a ready-made solution already tested in the market. Some examples of companies that have benefited from acquiring AI startups include Facebook’s acquisition of Wit.ai for natural language processing capabilities, Google’s acquisition of DeepMind for deep learning expertise, and Microsoft’s acquisition of Semantic Machines for conversational AI technology.

I believe the acquisition is the best way to exit an AI startup. Therefore, the rest of the chapter will focus on successfully planning and executing an exit strategy through acquisition.

#### Why Companies Acquire

Companies acquire other companies, including AI startups, to build on their strengths and weaknesses and achieve their business strategy. This method, also known as business acquisition or takeover, involves taking control of the interest and management of a targeted company. A company’s management team needs to analyze the market and consider how acquiring a company, including AI startups, can help achieve their business goals. Acquiring AI startups is often a strategic decision, as the startups may have unique technologies, talent, or intellectual property aligned with the acquirer’s business strategy.

Established companies often acquire AI startups as a strategic move to strengthen their market position by leveraging the startups’ capabilities and competencies in AI. One reason for the acquisition is the long-term bet to accelerate the overall business growth, as seen in Google’s acquisition of DeepMind, Amazon’s acquisition of Zoox, and Microsoft’s acquisition of Lobe.

Another reason is to strengthen the core AI platform by enhancing existing AI capabilities, such as Tesla’s acquisition of DeepScale, ServiceNow’s acquisition of Element AI and Loom Systems, and Skyfii’s acquisition of CrowdVision.

Companies may also acquire AI startups to add AI capability by integrating AI to have a stronger proposition in the market, as demonstrated by SAP’s acquisition of Qualtrics.

Another motive for acquisition is to acquire talented individuals who can contribute to the development of the acquiring company, such as Apple’s acquisition of Camerai. Companies may also acquire credentials such as ISO, standard, permit, certification, or license, which can increase their credibility in the market.

Acquiring base markets and IP (intellectual property) can enhance the acquirer’s valuation. Finally, acquiring institutional knowledge is also a possible reason for the acquisition. Functional knowledge in banking, manufacturing, or other areas is precious if the acquiring company’s management team lacks SME.

Technical know-how in AI operationalization is another valuable type of institutional knowledge that companies may seek through the acquisition.

In addition to the preceding reasons, another factor driving the acquisition of AI startups is the exclusive access to valuable datasets and partnerships that can help the acquiring company gain a competitive advantage in the market. Acquiring an AI startup can provide the acquiring company access to new and unique datasets that are not publicly available, giving them a head start in developing cutting-edge AI models. Furthermore, acquiring AI startups can also provide exclusive partnerships with other companies, research institutions, or government agencies, which can help the acquiring company stay ahead of the competition. For instance, Facebook’s acquisition of Wit.ai and Google’s acquisition of DeepMind provided access to new technologies and expertise and helped secure exclusive partnerships with leading research institutions in the field of AI.

#### The Importance of an Exit Plan

In the world of tech startups, it’s often said that _companies are not bought but sold_. This means that the founders of startups need to have an exit strategy planned from the beginning. They must always be ready to optimize all the essential aspects that can make their startup more attractive to potential acquirers.

The importance of planning an exit strategy cannot be overstated because failing to do so will leave the money on the table or, worst, leave the startup with zero value.

Instead of waiting for an acquirer to make an offer, founders should actively seek out potential acquirers who align with their startup’s strategic values and will appreciate its full range beyond just the financial aspect. In doing so, founders can optimize their exit strategy and secure the best possible deal for their startup at the right time.

Without an exit strategy, founders may find themselves stuck with a company that has become stagnant or is no longer profitable, without any clear way to liquidate their investment. To avoid this, founders must consider their company’s financial and strategic values, such as its intellectual property, unique selling proposition, and potential market share. By doing so, they can target the most appropriate acquirers and maximize the value of their startup.

One of the essential aspects of optimizing the value of a startup is targeting suitable acquirers. This requires founders to understand their industry and what acquirers seek in a startup. By identifying these factors early on, founders can tailor their company to be as attractive as possible to potential acquirers. This means focusing on building a strong brand and a unique product while keeping an eye on potential acquirers and their seeking.

It’s easy for founders to get lost in the day-to-day operations of their startup and forget about the end game of AI startups. However, planning for an exit from the beginning is crucial. This means clearly understanding the startup’s value, targeting suitable acquirers, and being ready to sell at the right time. Ultimately, a well-planned exit strategy can be the difference between success and failure for a tech startup.

Many founders of AI startups are missing out on potential success by waiting too long to sell their companies. In the fast-paced world of AI, products can become obsolete quickly due to changes in technology and the market. If founders do not sell at the right time, they risk losing everything they have worked for. They must take action and sell the AI startup when the time is right, or they may be left with nothing.

I believe that any AI startup founder must find the potential acquisitor as early as possible and sell when they are at the top of the game instead of selling when they have to.

#### Factors Impacting AI Startup Acquisition

The success of an AI startup acquisition depends on various factors that can impact the outcome. In our analysis of around 36 AI startups that have been successfully acquired, we have identified some of the most critical factors that can make a difference:

* _Strategic fit_: Avoid competing with big tech giants. Instead, find a strategic case where they can acquire an AI startup that will increase their strategic value, for example, Microsoft’s acquisition of Semantic Machines for conversational AI technology. The data also shows that only a small percentage (19%) of AI companies are acquired by companies within the same industry, as exemplified by the acquisition of Aidence, an AI-based radiology imaging company, by RadNet, a medical imaging company. This suggests that strategic match is more critical than industry similarity regarding AI acquisitions.
* _Focus on vertical products_: Most of the AI startups (87%) in the study focus on vertical products, which are specialized for specific industries. Strategic acquirers for these products are companies seeking to enhance their business with a specialized, vertical AI product. Only 13% of the companies in the study focus on horizontal products. An example is Gap’s acquisition of CB4 Analytics, a vertical AI-based retail analytics serving the retail market.
* _The management team_: The management team must consist of senior subject matter experts such as senior business executives and AI specialists with PhD and track records (as in publications and patents) and real-world implementation experience. An example is Apple’s acquisition of Emotient, whose co-founders were PhDs with expertise in AI, and the management also consists of experienced industry executives.
* _High-value business case_: The AI product must solve high-value business cases (i.e., add revenue or reduce cost significantly). An example is AppDynamics, an AI-based SaaS company for performance management and IT operations analytics that Cisco acquired in 2017 for $3.7 billion. AppDynamics’s AI-powered platform helps businesses monitor and optimize the performance of their applications, which is a critical function for many enterprise companies. The acquisition helped Cisco expand their IT management and analytics tools portfolio, and the high-value business case made AppDynamics an attractive target for acquisition.
* _Robust_: The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mindset doesn’t work well for AI, and founders must prove that the AI product works and can handle edge cases better than humans. An example is Vicarious, which developed a robust AI platform that uses the computational principles of the human brain to process information and learn from experience. Its technology can handle complex robotics tasks with excellent accuracy. In 2022, Vicarious was acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet company.
* _Reputable customers_: Most successfully acquired AI startups have a brand name as their customers, and due to the AI complexity, most AI startups are acquiring customers and early adopters through consultative sales. An example is CB4, a retail analytics startup that Gap acquired, that has retail brand names as their customers, such as Levi’s, Circle K, BestMarket, and Ace Hardware.
* _Reputable investor_: Successful AI startups are backed by prestigious global investors (Warburg Pincus, Goodwater Capital, Greylock Partners, Sequoia). This will attract other venture capital confidence to invest in your company by having world-known investors on your company track record. An example is AppDynamics, which has been invested in by Greylock Partners and acquired by Cisco.
* _Region_: A strategic acquirer is usually from the same area. This is due to the easiness of due diligence and the founders-acquirer background similarity. For example, BasisAI is a Singaporean AI startup acquired by Aicadium, a Singaporean AI technology company, because they are in the same Singapore technology ecosystem.
* _Strong intellectual property (IP) protection_: Having robust IP protection, such as patents and trademarks, can increase the startup’s value and make it more attractive to potential acquirers. For example, Clari DeepMap, which Nvidia acquired, has 32 patents, with 16 already granted.
* _Scalability_: The ability to scale the technology and business model is critical for the startup’s long-term success and makes it more attractive to potential acquirers.
* _Culture fit_: The cultural fit between the startup and the potential acquirer can play a significant role in the acquisition’s success, as it can impact the integration of the two companies and the retention of key talent.
* _Financials_: A strong financial performance, including revenue growth and profitability, can make the startup more attractive to potential acquirers and increase the company’s value.
* _Market traction_: Demonstrating traction in the market, such as through brand name customer acquisition and retention, can increase the startup’s value and make it more attractive to potential acquirers. For example, BasisAI has good customer growth. They already signed a contract with DBS, UOB, OCBC, ComfortDelGro, Singapore Airlines, Accenture, PwC, Amazon, and Singapore government as customers before being acquired by Aicadium, partly because of their fast customer growth in a short time.
* _Blue ocean competition_: An AI startup operating in a blue ocean competitive landscape with innovative and unique AI technology can be an attractive target for acquisition by a tech company looking to gain a competitive edge in the market. An example is Heron Systems, an AI startup that builds autonomous agents and multi-agent systems for modern war-fighting problems acquired by Shield AI. Their military technology is considered to be in a relatively blue ocean space, with only a few competitors.

#### Identifying Potential Acquirers

AI startups are looking for potential acquirers willing to pay a premium price for their products as the AI industry continues to expand at an astounding rate. Finding companies interested in buying your AI startup can be tricky, but it is doable with the appropriate strategy.

Our internal survey found that only 13% of acquired AI companies produce solutions exclusively applicable to horizontal markets. The remaining 87% are engaged in solutions focusing on vertical markets and are highly specialized for those markets. Specialized solutions are attractive to strategic acquirers who want to strengthen their position in a specific market or industry. Additionally, specialized solutions often solve high-value business cases, impacting an acquisition’s outcome.

When it comes to vertical AI startups, the typical strategic acquirer is a corporation that wants to acquire a specialized artificial intelligence product to improve their business. This type of acquirer is known as a vertical product acquirer. For example, a leader in the clothes retail business, Gap, decided to purchase CB4 Analytics, an artificial intelligence (AI)–based retail analytics startup, to achieve a competitive advantage in the retail industry.

Interestingly, just 19% of AI companies are purchased by other businesses operating in the same sector. This suggests that prospective purchasers are not always restricted to a single sector of the economy. The majority of artificial intelligence startups, according to the findings of the study, are typically bought by businesses operating in other fields. It suggests that the market for AI startups is not limited to a specific industry. Companies from various sectors are interested in acquiring AI startups to enhance their existing products or expand their market presence. This also highlights the importance of a strategic fit between the AI startup and the acquirer rather than industry similarity alone. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for AI startups to think beyond their own industry and be open to potential acquirers from various sectors.

Hence, to find potential acquirers for an AI company, it is vital to focus on businesses attempting to penetrate your industry but haven’t found a way in. This will help you find potential acquirers. Because they know they must be present in the market to maintain their competitiveness, these businesses are likelier to pay the highest rates.

    _Industry leaders and established players_: One way to identify potential acquirers for your AI startup is to look at industry leaders and established players in your niche. These companies may be interested in acquiring your technology to enhance their offerings or to gain a competitive advantage. For instance, if you have developed an AI-based tool for customer service, then call center market leaders such as Zendesk, Freshworks, or Genesys may be potential acquirers.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Private equity firms_: Private equity firms have the financial resources to acquire startups and can provide the necessary capital for growth and expansion. They often have expertise in specific industries and can provide valuable guidance and support to the startups they acquire.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Strategic partners_: Strategic partners are companies you have worked with or are currently working with to develop and market your technology. These companies may have a vested interest in acquiring your startup to gain access to your technology or to eliminate competition. For instance, if you have developed an AI-based market analysis tool, the market research consulting you have partnered with to test and market your product may be a potential acquirer.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Bigger competitors_: Bigger competitors are ideal AI startup acquirers as they offer resources and expertise to develop and scale the technology. They provide access to larger customer bases, distribution networks, infrastructure, and established processes. This accelerates growth in the fast-moving AI market. Larger competitors also provide financial resources, stability, and long-term innovation, which keep the startup competitive and push AI technology boundaries.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Customers_: Customers can be potential acquirers of AI startups as they have firsthand experience with the startup’s technology and see the benefit of acquiring it to gain exclusive access to that technology. Customers may also want to eliminate competition, expand their product offerings, or see an acquisition as a natural next step in their relationship if they have invested in the AI startup through funding or partnerships.

    &#x20;

In addition to understanding each potential acquisition’s pros and cons (Table [10-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_10\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)), it’s essential to understand your organization’s goals and priorities in the exit process and know what traits and criteria you’re looking for in potential acquirers. This can include cultural fit, ability to buy, motivation, competence in M\&A, and alignment of values. By considering these factors and using a targeted approach to identify potential acquirers, you can increase your chances of finding the right acquirer for your AI startup.Table 10-1&#x20;

Potential Acquirers and Their Pros and Cons

One effective way to find potential acquirers for your AI startup is through online platforms and marketplaces such as AngelList or Crunchbase. These platforms provide a wealth of information on companies in your industry or niche, including their funding, industry focus, and other relevant criteria. Using these platforms, you can identify potential acquirers interested in acquiring your AI technology to enhance their offerings or gain a competitive advantage.

Another effective way to find potential acquirers is attending industry conferences and events. These events offer an opportunity to network with potential acquirers and investors and learn more about your industry’s latest trends and developments. By attending these events and networking with attendees, you can identify potential acquirers interested in your AI startup and its technology. Furthermore, these events often have industry leaders and established players as attendees, making it an ideal place to connect with potential acquirers with the resources and expertise to develop further and scale your technology. Advisory firms can also be a valuable resource for identifying potential acquirers for AI startups. Investment banks, law firms, and other advisory firms specializing in mergers and acquisitions can provide expert guidance and advice on identifying potential acquirers and negotiating the terms of an acquisition. These firms deeply understand the market and can provide valuable insights on potential acquirers based on their experience working with companies in your industry or niche. They can also help you prepare for the acquisition process and ensure you get the best possible deal. Additionally, advisory firms can provide introductions and networking opportunities to potential acquirers, increasing your chances of success.

#### Understanding Your Strategic Value

When looking for potential acquirers, AI startup founders should focus on identifying and emphasizing intangible assets that can drive up the value of their company. These can include unique products and services that potential acquirers cannot find elsewhere. Having a strong, relevant, culturally accepted brand is also essential, as this can attract potential acquirers with excellent products but lack a strong brand. Intellectual property such as copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets are valuable intangible assets that can protect unique aspects of the business and attract premium acquirers.

Another key asset is a powerful, unique, and proprietary distribution network. Many potential acquirers are trying to expand their customer base, and a distribution network that is both powerful and unique can be very attractive to them. Additionally, having a loyal customer base can be very valuable as potential acquirers will see the value in having enthusiastic customers about the product or service.

Data is also an essential asset for AI startups as the accuracy and reliability of AI models depend on the data fed into the learning algorithms. If an AI startup has unique and diverse data acquired overtime, it can be more attractive to potential acquirers. Institutional knowledge, which refers to the tacit knowledge of building and solving problems using particular AI methods, can also be valuable to potential acquirers.

Finally, partner exclusivity, which refers to exclusivity in contracts or agreements, can be valuable for potential acquirers. For example, having unique technology vendors or long-term distribution deals with large technology distributors can be very attractive. This type of exclusivity can be worth a tremendous amount, especially if it is secured with an exclusive agreement before everyone knows about it. AI startup founders need to identify and implement as many forms of these value drivers or intangible assets as possible to stack value in their business.

#### Searching and Assessing a Potential Acquirer

Several factors must be considered to facilitate a successful transaction when considering whether a prospective acquirer is a good fit for your AI startup. These factors include

* Understanding your startup’s goals and top priorities and determining the characteristics and standards you seek in a prospective acquirer
* Identifying the reasons behind your decision to sell your business to narrow down the pool of potential acquirers who suit your objectives
* Identifying what kind of acquirer would be an excellent fit for your firm, whether it be an acquirer with strategic or financial interests
* Assessing whether or not a prospective acquirer is a good cultural match for your team’s employment and a successful merger
* Ensuring that the possible acquirer has the financial resources necessary to purchase your business
* Determining which businesses are driven by a feeling of urgency and have the motivation necessary to move forward with the purchase process
* Ascertaining whether or not your prospective purchaser possesses the level of expertise required to successfully complete the transaction
* Evaluating whether the potential acquirer’s values and commitments are aligned with your own

By carefully considering these factors, you can locate the ideal acquirer for your AI startup and pave the way for a successful acquisition.

To ensure a fruitful acquisition, thoroughly evaluating each potential acquirer is crucial for AI startups. One effective method of assessing acquirers is using a table that compares each candidate based on several key factors (Table [10-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_10\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)). This assessment table includes evaluating the value and culture match, financial capability, strategic alignment, urgency, and technology capability of potential acquirers. By carefully considering these factors, AI startups can make well-informed decisions and increase the chances of a successful acquisition.Table 10-2&#x20;

Assessment Table: AI Startup vs. Potential Acquirer

| Assessment Criteria     | Potential Acquirer A | Potential Acquirer B |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Value and culture match | 8/10                 | 9/10                 |
| Financial capability    | 10/10                | 7/10                 |

In the table (Table [10-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_10\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)), two potential acquirers have been assessed based on the five criteria. The scores assigned to each criterion represent the level of compatibility between the AI startup and the potential acquirer. By comparing the scores, the AI startup can determine which potential acquirer is the best fit for acquisition.

#### Approaching Potential Acquirers and Initiating Conversations

To successfully sell your AI startup, it is crucial to approach potential acquirers and initiate a dialogue with them effectively.

The following are some techniques to help you do so:

* Creating a compelling pitch that highlights the unique value proposition of your AI product or service is vital. The presentation should be tailored to address the potential acquirer’s strategic goals and concerns.
* Utilizing your network to communicate with prospective purchasers can be an effective method. Attending industry events and broadening your professional network can help you meet potential customers in person.
* Starting a targeted outreach method is important to reach out to potential customers. Researching the acquirer’s company and industry can help personalize your outreach according to their specific challenges.
* Emphasizing your track record of success with case studies and testimonials can help establish credibility and build confidence with prospective acquirers.
* Persistence and respect for the potential acquirer’s time and priorities are key factors in the process. When engaging with possible purchasers, you must follow up consistently while respecting their time and priorities.

Having different pitches for potential acquirers is important because it allows the startup to tailor their message and value proposition to each potential acquirer’s specific needs and goals. For example, if a startup is building computer vision systems for retail object classification and planogramming (Figure [10-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_10\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)), they may have different pitches for each potential acquirer:

* Suppose the potential acquirer is a retail analytics company. In that case, the startup could pitch that their computer vision system can complete the acquirer’s product portfolio and offerings, making them more competitive in the market.
* Suppose the potential acquirer is an ecommerce company. In that case, the startup could pitch that their computer vision system will improve the acquirer’s product search system, resulting in a better user experience and increased sales.

By customizing their pitch to each potential acquirer, the startup can better communicate the benefits of their product and increase the likelihood of a successful acquisition.

### Preparing the Company for Sale

Preparing a startup for sale requires careful consideration and strategic planning. It’s important to position the startup for sale, demonstrate its strategic value to potential acquirers, and create a compelling sales pitch and presentation. By following these guidelines, startups can increase their chances of successful acquisition and achieve their desired outcomes.

#### Maximizing AI Startup Value

When preparing an AI startup for a potential sale, it is important to recognize that acquirers are typically not solely interested in revenue or cash flow. Instead, the intangible assets of the company often hold the most value. It is crucial to recognize that while revenue and cash flow are desirable qualities in an AI startup, they are not the primary driver of an acquirer’s interest.

Building, operating, and selling AI products are intricate undertakings that pose significant financial challenges, making financial success unlikely to be the strongest suit of AI companies. Thus, AI startup founders need to identify intangible assets in their AI business, which can drive up the company’s value. While AI products may be a sound bargaining chip, they must solve specific questions to be valuable.

According to our benchmark studies, 24 AI products have been shown to reduce costs for customers, nine increase revenue, nine minimize security risks, and eight save time in customer processes. To maximize the value of the company when preparing for a sale, several key steps must be taken, including identifying and showcasing intangible assets, simplifying operations, documenting institutional knowledge, building a strong management team, and improving financial reporting.

A compelling narrative must be created that highlights the company’s value, positioning it as an attractive investment opportunity and maximizing its value in the eyes of potential acquirers.

First and foremost, you should focus on identifying and showcasing your intangible assets. These assets often make a company valuable, including product uniqueness, engineering and operationalization secret recipes, market share, customer loyalty, intellectual property, certifications gained, and more. Below are ways to determine the value of your intangible assets:

1.  1\.

    Show that your AI product results from years of real-world implementation and operationalization, with innovation and originality, proved in patents and scientific publications.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Conduct testimonials. By asking your customers how your product or service has benefited them in the past, you can identify specific metrics that demonstrate its value. For example, suppose your AI product has been testified quantitatively to reduce costs, increase revenue, reduce security risks, and save your customers’ time. In that case, these factors can justify a higher price tag for your company.

    &#x20;

Another important step to take when preparing for a sale is to streamline your operations and document your institutional knowledge systemically. This might involve simplifying your organizational structure, writing product documentation and standard operation procedure, adopting BPM (business process management) practice, and automating your development and operationalization of software and AI systems using DevOps, MLOps, and ModelOps. Doing so can increase your company’s profitability and demonstrate to potential acquirers that you are a well-managed organization.

In addition to these steps, retaining a solid management and technical team is essential. Acquirers want to see your company’s strong team that can drive growth, build innovative solutions, and manage operations effectively.

You should also improve your financial reporting and ensure your books are in order. This will help build confidence in potential acquirers and demonstrate that your company is a good investment opportunity. Ultimately, when preparing for a sale, the goal is to create a compelling narrative showcasing your company’s value.

Therefore highlighting your intangible assets (IP, managed institutional knowledge), demonstrating your operational efficiency, structuring your technical and financial documentation, and showcasing your strong team will position your company as an attractive acquisition opportunity and maximize its value in the eyes of potential acquirers.

#### Valuation Methods for AI Startups

Valuation is essential for any startup seeking investment or sale. The value of a startup is not just limited to its monetary worth but also includes factors like intangible assets, uniqueness, and the quality of its team. Determining startup valuation can be approached through subjective and objective methods, such as researching valuations for comparable companies, constructing a revenue or EBITDA multiple, and assessing the industry’s market size and situation.

Here are brief explanations of the ten common methods for determining startup valuation:

1.  1\.

    _Standard Earnings Multiple Method_: This method calculates a startup’s value based on a multiple of its one to three years’ average profit. Investors commonly use it to determine a company’s free cash flow and potential for driving incremental value to a purchaser. In the case of AI startups, the multiple typically ranges between 5 and 8 × the past three years’ average EBITDA (yearly), while in SaaS businesses, it may fall in the 8–12 range.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Human Capital Plus Market Value Method_: This method assesses a startup’s team’s value and potential market size. The investor evaluates the team’s expertise and calculates a mathematical valuation based on the obtainable market volume. It helps assess a startup’s potential for future profits.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _5x Your Raise Method_: This method determines a startup’s value based on the amount of money it has raised. It is commonly used in conversations between startups and venture capitalists, and the idea behind this method is that a startup’s value should be five times the amount of money it has raised.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Scorecard Method_: This method uses a weighted scoring system to assign a score to various factors such as the team, market, product, and traction. These scores are then used to determine the overall value of the startup.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _First Principles Method_: This method breaks down a startup’s value into its individual components, such as its technology, market, and team, and values each component separately. It is based on the concept of reducing a complex problem to its basic elements and then building it back up.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Pre-money Method_: This method calculates a startup’s value before an investment is made based on its assets, liabilities, and potential future revenue.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _Post-money Method_: This method calculates a startup’s value after an investment is made based on its assets, liabilities, and potential future revenue, taking into account the investment made.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    _Real Options Method_: This method values a startup based on its potential future options and how they affect its value. It involves assessing a startup’s potential future opportunities, such as the ability to enter new markets or develop new products.

    &#x20;
9.  9\.

    _Market Approach Method_: This method determines a startup’s value based on its potential market value. It involves assessing the market demand for a startup’s product or service and the competition in the market.

    &#x20;
10. 10\.

    _Cost Approach Method_: This method calculates a startup’s value based on the cost of creating a similar business from scratch. It is based on the concept of a startup’s potential future income.

    &#x20;

The most common method to value AI startups is the Standard Earnings Multiple Method, which calculates the startup’s valuation based on a multiple of its past three years’ average EBITDA. The multiple for AI startups is typically between 5 and 8 × the past three years’ average EBITDA, although for SAAS businesses, it can range from 8 to 12.

Many investors prefer this method as it provides insight into the company’s free cash flow and how it will drive incremental value to a purchaser. The Standard Earnings Multiple Method is a popular valuation method as it is relatively simple to calculate and objectively measures the startup’s financial performance.

It also allows investors to assess the potential return on investment for the purchaser, which is important when considering the purchase of an AI startup. Additionally, the method is useful for valuing AI startups with a proven track record of profitability, which can be difficult to value using other methods that focus on future potential.

AI startups have smaller multiples than SaaS because AI startups often require more significant investments in data acquisition, computing infrastructure, and research and development, resulting in lower profit margins and higher operating costs.

Additionally, AI startups may have a longer sales cycle as they may need to consult with potential customers to customize their solutions, which can further impact their revenue and profitability.

On the other hand, SaaS businesses generally have lower operational costs and higher margins due to their scalable and repeatable subscription-based business model. Moreover, AI startups are often still in the development stage, with uncertain revenue streams and higher levels of risk. While AI technology has the potential to be highly profitable and disruptive, it can take time for startups to generate consistent revenue and demonstrate their ability to scale. These factors can contribute to the differences in multiples between AI startups and SaaS businesses.

Valuating an AI startup can be complex, as many factors exist beyond revenue or profit. However, here is a simplified step-by-step approach to valuate an AI startup:

1.  1\.

    Identify the company’s stage of development. Is the company in the seed stage or growth stage? This will help determine the type of valuation method to use.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Determine the company’s current and future potential revenues. Estimate the company’s current and future potential revenues based on the market size and competitive landscape. This can be done by looking at similar companies in the same industry and their revenue growth rates.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Assess the company’s assets and liabilities. Consider the company’s assets and liabilities, including intellectual property, patents, brand reputation, and outstanding debts or legal issues.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Choose a valuation method. As discussed earlier, several methods can be used to value an AI startup. One of the most common is the Standard Earnings Multiple Method. This involves taking the company’s average EBITDA over the past three years and multiplying it by a factor of 5–8 for AI-first startups and AI toolkit startups or 8–12 for AI-powered SaaS startups. This will provide an estimated valuation range for the company.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Consider scenario analysis to account for the uncertainties in the startup’s future revenue growth and market conditions. Conducting scenario analysis with pessimistic, conservative, and optimistic scenarios is useful. This involves estimating the company’s valuation under each scenario to give a range of potential valuations.

    &#x20;

For example, an AI startup has had an average EBITDA of $500,000 over the past three years, and the Standard Earnings Multiple Method suggests a valuation range of $2.5–4 million. A scenario analysis might produce the following valuations:

* _Pessimistic scenario_: Revenue growth slows, and the company only achieves a valuation of $2.5 million.
* _Baseline scenario_: The company continues its current growth rate, resulting in a valuation of $3.5 million.
* _Optimistic scenario_: The company experiences rapid growth and is valued at $4 million.

By considering multiple scenarios, you can better understand the potential range of valuations for the startup, which can help guide negotiations with potential investors or acquirers.

#### Creating a Compelling Story

When selling a company, creating a compelling sales pitch and story is crucial to attracting potential acquirers. It is not sufficient to talk about the company’s historical performance. While a company’s past performance is important, it is equally essential to communicate its future goals and potential growth and innovation. This approach enables potential acquirers to envision the company’s potential growth and creates excitement about the possibility of acquiring the company.

In addition to discussing the company’s future goals and growth potential, it is essential to present the company’s strategic alignment and financial aspects from the acquirer’s perspective. A more compelling story that demonstrates how the AI product can benefit the acquirer’s business and innovation strategy can be used to illustrate the future possibilities of the acquisition. It is essential to picture the future for the acquirer company and highlight how the acquisition news in the media could boost the stock value and the investors’ excitement.

Remembering that potential acquirers often have more resources than the company being sold is essential. They believe they can do better with those resources, so it is important to leverage the acquirer’s perspective and math. For example, if a company has a small team and generates a revenue of US $1 million, a potential acquirer with a three-time team size can envision the three-time potential revenue they could generate with the products.

Let’s learn from some hypothetical case studies. Niramai is an Indian healthcare AI startup focusing on early breast cancer detection through AI-powered thermography. To pitch their company to healthcare technology giants such as Siemens Healthineers, GE Healthcare, or Medtronic, Niramai would need to emphasize its unique value proposition and future growth potential:

1.  1\.

    Niramai would need to present a compelling story about how their technology will benefit the acquirer’s business and innovation strategy. They would need to highlight how their AI-powered thermography can complement existing imaging technologies used by these companies and provide a more accurate and cost-effective solution for early breast cancer detection. For example, they could emphasize the potential cost savings for the healthcare giants and how their technology can enhance patient care by detecting cancer at an earlier stage.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Niramai would need to present a clear and comprehensive vision for the company’s future. This would involve showcasing their future goals and how they plan to achieve them. For example, they could discuss plans to expand into other markets, develop new AI-powered products, or partner with other healthcare organizations.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Niramai would need to use scenario analysis to demonstrate the company’s potential value to the healthcare giants. This would involve presenting different scenarios with optimistic, conservative, and pessimistic projections of the company’s future growth and revenue potential. For example, they could present a scenario where their technology is adopted globally, resulting in significant revenue growth and market domination. They could also present a scenario where the technology is slow to be adopted, resulting in slower revenue growth and market penetration.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Niramai must demonstrate their ability to execute their plans and deliver results. This would involve highlighting their team’s expertise, experience, and track record of success. For example, they could showcase the credentials of their management team, the awards they have received, the patents granted, and the partnerships they have formed.

    &#x20;

In conclusion, creating a compelling sales pitch and story highlighting the company’s future growth and innovation, leveraging the acquirer’s perspective and math, and picturing the future for the acquirer company is critical to successfully selling a company. A well-crafted sales pitch that illustrates the company’s potential can attract potential acquirers and generate excitement about the possibility of acquiring the company.

### Negotiating the Sale

Negotiating the sale of an AI startup can be a complex and daunting process. It involves a variety of considerations, including legal and financial matters, as well as technical and labor aspects. To successfully navigate this process, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the negotiation strategies and techniques, the key legal and financial considerations, and the due diligence process. Also, handling objections and counteroffers is critical to successful sales. In this context, technical and labor due diligence are important for assessing the technical and human resources of the AI startup. This introduction will provide an overview of the key considerations involved in negotiating the sale of an AI startup, including negotiating the terms of the sale, handling objections and counteroffers, key legal and financial considerations, and technical, labor, financial, and legal due diligence.

#### Negotiating the Terms of the Sale

You’ve done the prep work and presented and met with potential acquirers. Next, the interested acquirers will sign letters of intent (LOIs) plus Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Selling an AI company involves a complex set of considerations that must be examined when reviewing an LOI. While an LOI is merely a tentative expression of interest, an LOI carries more weight and typically involves more serious discussions between the parties involved.

Before accepting an LOI, it is important to understand that it is a non-binding document outlining the proposed transaction’s key terms and conditions. While it is not legally binding, it serves as a roadmap for negotiations between the parties and sets the framework for the deal’s final agreement. It is also important to ensure that the LOI contains adequate protections for the seller, such as due diligence and confidentiality provisions.

It is worth noting that while an LOI is an essential step in the M\&A process, it does not guarantee that a deal will ultimately be reached. Further negotiations and due diligence may be required before the parties can reach a final agreement. Sometimes we can have a more detailed document that outlines the basic terms of the potential deal, including the purchase price, the structure of the transaction, and any contingencies or conditions referred to as a term sheet. As such, having a qualified legal and financial team on board is important to guide you through the process and protect your interests.

First and foremost, the value of the technology, especially related to AI being sold, must be carefully evaluated. This may include the company’s proprietary algorithms, datasets, MLOps/ModelOps platform, and machine learning models, which could significantly impact the deal’s purchase price and payment structure.

Evaluating the acquirer’s technical capabilities and experience in the AI industry is also crucial. The acquirer’s expertise in the field could be crucial in ensuring the continued success of the company post-acquisition. The acquirer’s plans for integrating the company’s technology into their own operations and how they intend to leverage the technology to achieve their strategic goals should be examined.

Another critical consideration is the potential impact of the acquisition on employees, customers, and other stakeholders. The acquirer’s plans for retaining key employees, maintaining customer relationships, and managing any potential reputational risks should be closely evaluated. In some cases, it may be necessary to negotiate specific protections for employees, such as retention bonuses or guarantees of job security.

The terms of the deal itself should also be carefully evaluated. The purchase price, payment structure, and any contingencies or conditions that must be satisfied before closing the deal should be reviewed in detail. This could include conditions related to the company’s financial performance, intellectual property ownership, or regulatory compliance. It is essential to ensure that the LOI contains adequate protections for the seller, such as due diligence and confidentiality provisions.

In addition to these factors, it is important to be aware of any relevant regulations or legal requirements that may impact the sale. For example, if the company’s technology involves the use of personal data, the sale may be subject to data protection laws and regulations. Compliance with privacy law, competition law, and other relevant laws should also be considered.

Overall, selling an AI company requires careful consideration of various factors, including the value of the technology, the acquirer’s capabilities, the impact on stakeholders, and any legal or regulatory requirements. By engaging qualified legal and financial experts and carefully reviewing the terms proposed in an LOI, the seller can ensure that they make informed decisions and protect their interests throughout the process. With the right approach, a successful sale can result in a positive outcome for both the seller and the acquirer.

#### Handle Objections and Counteroffers

When it comes to handling objections and counteroffers in the context of M\&A, it is important to remember that negotiations can be complex and multifaceted. It is about getting the best price for your company and ensuring that the deal terms are fair, reasonable, and aligned with your strategic objectives.

One important aspect of handling objections and counteroffers is maintaining a positive and constructive tone throughout the negotiation process. Even if you disagree with the acquirer’s position, it is important to maintain a professional and courteous demeanor and to focus on finding common ground and working toward a mutually beneficial solution.

Another critical strategy for handling objections and counteroffers is to be proactive in anticipating and addressing potential issues before they become deal-breakers. This requires a deep understanding of your company’s strengths, weaknesses, and value proposition and a thorough knowledge of the market and industry trends.

In some cases, it may be necessary to bring in outside experts or advisors to help you navigate complex issues or respond to objections from potential acquirers. This may include legal counsel, financial analysts, or industry consultants who can provide specialized expertise and guidance.

Ultimately, the key to successfully handling objections and counteroffers in M\&A is to remain flexible, creative, and strategic in your approach. This may involve exploring alternative deal structures or financing options or rethinking certain aspects of the deal to address the acquirer’s concerns. Focusing on your strategic objectives and staying open to new ideas and approaches can increase your chances of achieving a successful outcome and maximizing your company’s value.

It is also worth noting that effective communication and transparency are critical to managing objections and counteroffers in M\&A. Be honest and up front about your concerns and goals, and encourage the acquirer to do the same. This can help build trust and foster a productive negotiation process, ultimately leading to a successful deal.

In conclusion, handling objections and counteroffers is critical to the M\&A process and requires careful planning, communication, and strategic thinking. By staying focused on your strategic objectives, remaining flexible and creative, and seeking expert guidance when needed, you can confidently navigate the negotiation process and achieve a successful outcome that maximizes your company’s value.

In addition to the strategies mentioned earlier, it is important to understand the acquirer’s perspective and motivations when handling objections and counteroffers. By understanding what the acquirer is looking for in the deal, you can tailor your responses and solutions to meet their needs and expectations better.

It is also crucial to clearly understand the market and industry trends, as this can help you anticipate potential objections and counteroffers from acquirers. This includes being aware of new competitors, market disruptors, and emerging technologies that may impact your company’s value.

Another important consideration when handling objections and counteroffers is a strong understanding of your company’s intellectual property (IP) portfolio. This includes patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Acquirers may be concerned about potential IP infringement or litigation, so addressing these concerns early in the negotiation process is important.

However, an acquirer may make a counteroffer that includes an _earn-out clause_, which means that a portion of the purchase price is contingent on the company achieving certain financial or operational targets after the sale. While this can be an attractive option for acquirers who want to mitigate risk, it can also be a source of contention for sellers who may feel their company’s value is undervalued. In these cases, it is important to carefully evaluate the terms of the earn-out and negotiate for fair and reasonable terms.

Lastly, it is important to clearly understand the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding the sale of an AI company. This includes compliance with data privacy laws, intellectual property regulations, and antitrust laws. Ensuring compliance with these regulations is critical to avoid potential legal issues and delays in the sale process.

In essence, when handling objections and counteroffers in the context of selling an AI company, it is important to maintain a positive and constructive tone, be proactive in anticipating potential issues, seek expert guidance when needed, and understand the acquirer’s perspective and motivations. By keeping these strategies in mind and staying focused on your strategic objectives, you can confidently navigate the negotiation process and achieve a successful outcome that maximizes your company’s value.

#### Key Legal and Financial Considerations During the Negotiation Process

In addition to regulatory issues, several other legal and financial aspects should be considered during the negotiation process:

* _Terms of the deal/term sheet_: It is important to carefully evaluate the terms of the deal to ensure that they are fair and reasonable. It is also important to make sure that they are aligned with your strategic objectives. This includes considering the purchase price, payment structure, earn-out clauses, and any other terms that may impact the value of the deal.
* _Tax implication_: It is important to have a thorough understanding of the tax implications of the sale, both for your company and for the individual shareholders. This includes evaluating the tax implications of different deal structures, such as stock sales vs. asset sales, and considering strategies for minimizing tax liabilities.
* _Legal documentation_: It is important to ensure that all necessary legal documents are in order and that the transaction is properly documented. This includes drafting and negotiating the purchase agreement, conducting due diligence, and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
* _Communication strategy_: It is important to consider the impact of the sale on your employees, customers, and other stakeholders. This includes developing a communication strategy to ensure that employees are kept informed about the sale and its potential impact on their jobs and working with customers to ensure a smooth transition.
* _Post-transaction integration_: It is important to have a plan in place for post-transaction integration, to ensure that the company can continue to operate smoothly and effectively under new ownership. This includes identifying key personnel and ensuring that they are retained, developing a plan for integrating technology and systems, and establishing clear lines of communication between the new ownership and existing employees.

In short, there are several key legal and financial considerations to keep in mind during the negotiation process when selling an AI company. These include regulatory issues, purchase price and payment structure, tax implications, legal documentation, employee and stakeholder impact, and post-transaction integration. By carefully considering these factors and seeking expert guidance when needed, you can navigate the sale process with confidence and achieve a successful outcome that maximizes the value of your company.

#### Due Diligence

Due diligence is crucial for the acquisition of an AI startup as it verifies the company’s information, operations, and financial performance to ensure that the acquisition is profitable. Technical, labor, financial, and legal due diligence are important aspects of the acquisition process for AI startup founders. Technical due diligence examines the startup’s technology, while labor due diligence reviews the workforce. Financial due diligence analyzes the financial statements, and legal due diligence ensures compliance with regulations. Preparing for due diligence is crucial for AI startup founders, such as organizing financial and legal documents, establishing clear intellectual property ownership, and developing a strong technical team. Thorough due diligence can lead to a successful acquisition and a strong foundation for future growth and success.

In this section, we will describe a step-by-step process for conducting the four types of due diligence: technical, labor, financial, and legal. Every kind of due diligence requires a specific set of procedures to ensure a thorough investigation of the startup’s operations, assets, and potential liabilities. By following these steps, acquirers can gain a clear understanding of the startup’s technical capabilities, workforce, financial performance, and legal compliance and make informed decisions about the viability of the acquisition.

It’s important to note that the results of the due diligence process can also impact the negotiation terms, particularly the purchase price. For example, suppose the due diligence reveals potential legal or financial risks. In that case, the acquirer may be more hesitant to proceed with the acquisition or may negotiate a lower purchase price to account for the additional risks. On the other hand, if the due diligence reveals strong technical capabilities or potential for future growth, the acquirer may be willing to offer a higher purchase price to secure the acquisition. Therefore, AI startup founders need to be aware of the due diligence process and ensure that their company is well-prepared to address any potential issues that may arise during the process. This can help maximize the value of the company and lead to a successful acquisition.

**Technical Due Diligence**

Technical due diligence is a crucial aspect of the acquisition process for AI startups. This involves an in-depth examination of the technical details related to the startup’s products, systems, operations, and procedures to ensure that the acquirer fully understands the technology and potential risks involved. Here are the steps for technical due diligence:

1.  1\.

    _Product roadmap review_: Review the product roadmap of the AI startup. This will provide insight into the company’s future product development plans and how they align with the acquirer’s business goals.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _System architecture and infrastructure review_: Examine the system architecture and infrastructure of the AI startup. This includes a review of the hardware and software systems, network topology, and cloud services used by the startup.

Additionally, the acquirer should evaluate the AI platform used by the startup and determine its capabilities and limitations.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Dataset review_: The acquirer should review the datasets the AI startup uses to train its models. This includes an examination of the quality, quantity, and diversity of the data. It should also verify that the data is ethically sourced and compliant with relevant regulations.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Documentation review_: In this step, the acquirer should review the startup’s documentation, including technical specifications, user manuals, and API documentation.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Process review_: The acquirer should review the startup’s process for developing and deploying its AI products. This includes an assessment of the team’s skills and experience and how they collaborate to deliver quality products. The acquirer should also assess the startup’s development process, including its use of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) and MLOps. The acquirer should also evaluate the startup’s service delivery process and determine if it aligns with its own processes.

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: IDENTIFAI ACQUISITION

**Introduction**

Identifai, an AI startup specializing in biometrics-based eKYC technology, was recently acquired by a confidential acquirer. In this case study, we will examine the key factors that led to the success of this acquisition, including Identifai’s unique technology, competitive advantages, and strong business team. We will also look at the process of Identifai’s acquisition, including the selection of potential acquirers, negotiations, due diligence, and post-acquisition integration.

**Identifai’s Unique Technology**

Identifai had an advanced R\&D team of world experts with PhD and master’s in computer vision and deep learning. A top confidential investor invested in their AI technology. They had IP on advanced liveness detection computer vision models with explainable AI capability, the first in the world. Identifai also had a proprietary algorithm that enabled face matching with millions of facial data in under one second. They had already integrated with the Indonesian citizen ID database with 208 million IDs stored.

**Identifai’s Competitive Advantages**

Despite having several competitors, Identifai was the eKYC market leader in Indonesia, and they had secured more than 40 brand names in banks and FinTech. Even though their EBITDA was still low, their growth potential was huge. Identifai founders had already set up an exit plan and were scouting potential acquirers.

**The Acquisition Process**

Identifai’s team found three potential acquirer candidates: national digital banks (buyer 1), a FinTech company (buyer 2), and a market leader technology company specializing in digital signature (buyer 3). The Identifai team assessed the three candidates and decided that buyer 3, the market leader technology company specializing in digital signature, had an edge in strategy and culture match, was financially secure, was ready to buy, and had an advanced technology team. The Identifai team pitched the story that their eKYC technology would complete the portfolio of buyer 3 and enable them to become the market leader of digital verification platforms in Southeast Asia, even Asia.

The Identifai team showed testimonials from satisfied customers in national banks and FinTech and provided three scenarios of potential revenues for buyer 3: pessimistic, baseline, and optimistic. After negotiations, both parties, Identifai and buyer 3, agreed on a price. They signed an LOI and NDA, agreeing on the terms of the sale, including retaining key employees, maintaining key customers, and transferring IPs.

**Due Diligence**

Buyer 3 performed comprehensive technical, commercial, financial, and labor due diligence. Upon technical due diligence, it was found out that some dataset was proprietary and could not be transferred, so they renegotiated the price. The new price was agreed upon, and the Identifai team signed the final agreement and transferred ownership of the company.

**Post-acquisition Integration**

Identifai and buyer 3 then began communicating the acquisition to customers and partners. They worked together to create a clear and concise message about the acquisition, emphasizing customer benefits and the commitment to maintaining quality service. They also outlined any potential technical or operational impacts and worked to address any concerns or questions that arose from customers or partners.

Novation agreements had to be signed with all of Identifai’s customers to finalize the acquisition. The vast majority of customers were happy to continue their relationship with buyer 3, but a few were unwilling to sign the novation agreement. Buyer 3 worked to understand their concerns and, in some cases, offered additional incentives or accommodations to try to keep the customer relationship intact. Ultimately, four customers decided to end their relationship with Identifai/buyer 3.

Once the acquisition was finalized and all necessary agreements were signed, Identifai’s technology and systems needed to be migrated and integrated with buyer 3’s existing infrastructure. This process required careful planning and coordination between the Identifai and buyer 3 technical teams, as they were using different cloud providers and had different system architectures. After several months of work, the migration was completed successfully.

With the systems fully integrated, the Identifai team began working as part of buyer 3 to serve customers and develop new products and services. The team was able to leverage its expertise in biometrics eKYC technology to enhance buyer 3’s digital verification platform and further solidify its position as a market leader in Southeast Asia and beyond.

In conclusion, the acquisition of Identifai by buyer 3 was a complex but ultimately successful process. Identifai’s strong position in the eKYC market and cutting-edge biometrics technology made it an attractive acquisition target for several potential buyers. By carefully assessing the different options and selecting the most suitable buyer based on culture fit, financial security, and technical capabilities, Identifai was able to secure a reasonable price for its technology and ensure a smooth transition for its employees and customers. Despite some challenges, the acquisition was completed successfully, and the combined expertise of Identifai and buyer 3 is now driving innovation and growth in the digital verification space.

### Final Thoughts

The future of AI startups is indeed very promising, and we are currently witnessing the emergence of new and exciting AI technologies that are based on generative AI. In fact, when this book was written, OpenAI announced the release of GPT-4, marking the beginning of the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI), where machines can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. This new era, characterized by the incredible proficiency of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, signals a breakthrough in our understanding and application of AI. However, it’s essential to note that the road to AGI is not without its challenges.

Despite the leaps in innovation, LLM-based generative models still grapple with issues of unpredictability. Therefore, while LLMs like GPT-4 signal the dawn of the AGI era, more traditional AI methods based on artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) principles are far from obsolete.

ANI, characterized by its specialization in one narrowly defined task, offers a level of predictability and control that LLMs currently struggle to match. ANI-based models have been widely applied in enterprise settings, offering reliable solutions to specific problems – from spam filtering and recommendation systems to fraud detection and customer segmentation. Despite lacking the “general” intelligence of LLMs, these systems have been battle-tested and refined over years of enterprise use.

The strengths of ANI – its predictability, controllability, and proven effectiveness in enterprise settings – ensure its continued relevance in the AI landscape. Thus, as we stand on the brink of the AGI era, we find ourselves in a hybrid landscape where the broad capabilities of LLMs coexist with the targeted effectiveness of ANI-based solutions, one complementing the other’s strengths and mitigating its weaknesses.

As AI technology advances and evolves, we can expect it to become even more integrated into every aspect of our lives. This means that businesses of all kinds must be prepared to leverage AI in some way in order to stay competitive. It is, therefore, essential for business executives, entrepreneurs, product managers, and software engineering professionals to understand how to effectively leverage this incredible technology to create innovative and successful AI startups. In the future, we anticipate AI startups to be better equipped in addressing critical global issues such as climate change, cancer, diabetes, hunger, waste management, energy, and clean water.
