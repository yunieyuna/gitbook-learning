# 5. AI Product Strategy

In the previous chapters, we learned how to validate AI products for B2B and B2D markets. After we validate the market, the next step is to build a sound product strategy essential to the overall process. The product strategy guides decisions regarding the vision and mission of the product, the outcome expected for the customers, the stakeholders involved in their development and marketing efforts, and other crucial aspects necessary for success, like desired feature sets.

In this chapter, we will learn about how to build an AI product and translate it into a roadmap by following the five-step AI product strategy lifecycle framework: First, we must define product vision and objectives. Second, we perform product discovery followed by collaborative requirements analysis, and then we do product prioritization. Finally, we evaluate the roadmap efficacy to measure whether or not our product roadmap is fulfilling our objectives.

The process is a collaborative effort comprising stakeholders directly or indirectly involved with the product. After finishing this chapter, you can create a robust and dynamic AI product strategy as a product roadmap.

We will also learn about AI product lifecycle management, which is the strategic process of managing a product lifecycle, from initial ideation to retirement, based on the advancement and AI technology hype cycle.

### Product Strategy Fundamental

It’s essential to clearly understand what your product should achieve and how that supports the organization. A clear objective will help you define all aspects of your product, including an end-to-end vision for success.

Product strategy is about defining what your product should achieve and how that supports the organization. The product strategy is represented through a roadmap that outlines an end-to-end vision for achieving this goal in full detail with specifics on getting there from where we are now. We will follow a five-step product strategy lifecycle framework that is suitable for enterprise AI products (Figure [5-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)):

1.  1\.

    _Product visioning_: Building product vision, objectives, and principles.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Product discovery_: Understanding customer problems and needs.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Product requirements analysis_: Understanding the reasoning of the requirements deeply (5W1H – Why, What, When, Who, Where, How) and categorizing them into tactical, strategic, and disruptive features.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Product prioritization_: We are prioritizing the features in the product roadmap.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Roadmap efficacy evaluation_: Measuring the effectiveness of the product roadmap relative to product objectives. We can adjust the product objectives and the following steps if there is a discrepancy.

    &#x20;

Steps 1–5 are continuously performed cycles during a product’s lifetime (Figure [5-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).

#### Product Roadmap

A product roadmap is a strategic plan that outlines a series of tactical steps aligning with the company’s goals to push forward in its planned direction.

Product roadmaps are plans of action that reflect product strategy. The goal is to outline all the necessary tasks related to developing and launching new products, service offerings, or feature sets for the company’s portfolio and any promotional campaigns and go-to-market strategy needed.

The roadmap’s purpose is to outline the plan for both the customer and the company. There are two purposes of the roadmap:

* _Giving the direction_: A product without a roadmap is directionless.
* _Giving clarity_: Lack of clarity results in stakeholders steering the product in multiple conflicting directions, with impact:
  * Sales growth is stagnant.
  * Gaps widen with competitors.
  * Lack of innovation and excitement.
  * High turnover due to low confidence in the product.

However, there is a prerequisite before we can define a good product roadmap. The product needs to have a solid Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) validation first.

A product roadmap also has a different audience, internal and external. Anyone outside the product/AI and engineering/development team is considered an external audience. Therefore, we should write two different roadmaps: an external and an internal roadmap (Table [5-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 5-1&#x20;

Roadmap, Audience, and Its Component

| Component    | External Roadmap                                                                                   | Internal Roadmap                                                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audience** | Audience: customers, sales team, AM, BD/partnership.                                               | Audience: product/engineering/AI team.                                                       |
| **Delivery** | Outlines outcome or value delivered to the customer (end user and developer user) in each release. | Outlines a detailed list of features delivered in each release, including internal features. |
| **Features** | Conceals internal features that do not directly impact customers.                                  | Every feature committed in each release will be visible.                                     |
| **Reviewer** | Various stakeholders reviewed what to share, how much to share, and when to share.                 | Reviewed and mutually agreed by both PM and engineering/AI team.                             |
| **Feedback** | Feedback was gathered from feedback forms, questionnaires, and user interviews.                    | Feedback gathered from customer services/service delivery and PMs.                           |

No matter what, a product roadmap is not a committed plan carved on rocks. We need to continuously adapt to changes and new situations in the business world. We must also never prepare the product roadmap in reactive mode. Every item added to the roadmap is carefully evaluated by the following criteria:

* How does it help customers’ (end users and developers) business?
* How does it help in achieving product objectives?
* How does it help realize product purpose?
* Is it aligned with product strategy?

#### Define Product Vision, Strategy, and Roadmap

The product roadmap is a plan of action consisting of tactical steps to execute product strategy pushing the product ahead in the trajectory of planned direction in alignment with product vision while accomplishing short-term and long-term product objectives.

So to have a sound product roadmap, the first reasonable step is to define product vision, which is the statement of the value of your product, followed by defining product strategy, which represents the path to accomplish the product vision. Finally, we outline a product roadmap as tactical steps to execute the product strategy (Figure [5-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="885" width="892"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

Product vision is usually also company vision, especially if your company only has a single product.

Product vision defines the true purpose of the product or why the product exists. Product vision shows clarity on the overall direction of the product.

Two essential aspects drive product vision:

* _Product principles/purpose_: The set of principles of the product that is a core belief in the existence of the product. To define this, we need to answer these questions:
  * What is the core belief of the organization?
  * What is the true purpose and reason behind the creation of the product?
  * What is the future that the organization intends to create?
* _Product objectives_: The mission of the product. To define this, we need to answer these questions:
  * What are the tangible values for the customers?
  * What are the tangible goals for the organization?

Some examples of vision and mission from leading AI companies are shown in Figures [5-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3) and [5-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="396" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="402" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

The product strategy is a high-level plan that describes what the company hopes to accomplish with its products and the steps to achieve that.

Product strategy consists of several sub-steps, as depicted in Figure [5-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1):

1.  1\.

    Product discovery is a method to help product managers refine their ideas by exploring all possible options and strategies that solve customers’ problems effectively. Product discovery is supposed to focus on user outcomes instead of features.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Product requirements analysis defines your new product’s features and functions to fulfill the expected outcome. The outcome is this step’s backlogs with requirements categories (tactical, strategic, and disruptive).

    &#x20;

After the product strategy is defined, we write down a prioritized roadmap. The detailed process is depicted in Figure [5-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="777" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

This whole process aims to match the product roadmap with business objectives. In essence, what we do consists of the following:

1.  1\.

    Define our belief in vision, mission, and principles.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Define product objectives based on customer value by discovering their requirements.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Churn out product backlogs and categorize them into tactical, strategic, or disruptive features.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Prioritize the backlogs based on the current market conditions and trends.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Evaluate whether or not we have attained our objectives.

    &#x20;

The following sections will discuss product discovery, requirements analysis, and prioritization.

### Product Discovery

In many startups, the product backlogs and requirements are made based on the request of the customer or business development team, which is not an ideal case. The product team should not let customers dictate what to develop. Instead, they must discover the business challenges and problems (which can be translated into needs) of the customers and, along with the technical team, derive the optimal solution (requirements) that would address the business challenges (Figure [5-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)). Finally, the requirements will be mapped into features consumed by the users.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig6_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="543" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-6 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Understanding Customer Needs

Understanding customers is by delivering what they need and not what they ask, because what customers say they want and what they need are entirely different. Understanding customers identifies what they need to deliver outcomes beyond their expectations.

For AI products, we can use the SETDA framework to determine the customers’ needs by considering which challenges, problematic or tedious cognitive tasks, can be assisted, augmented, or performed by AI in a more scalable way (Figure [5-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)).

1.  1.We categorize the cognitive challenges into three categories:

    * Generating revenue or a new business model
    * Reducing cost/improving operational efficiency
    * Reducing and managing risk

    These three challenges will be excellent outcomes if we manage to solve them using AI products.

    &#x20;
2.  2.For each potential outcome, we define the AI methods suitable to realize the outcome:

    1.  i.

        _Sense_: The cognitive task is related to perceiving information from the world and transforming it into data.

        &#x20;
    2.  ii.

        _Explain_: Cognitive tasks related to summarizing, analyzing, and visualizing facts and data.

        &#x20;
    3.  iii.

        _Think_: Cognitive tasks are related to correlating, predicting, and reasoning, something like insight.

        &#x20;
    4.  iv.

        _Decide_: Cognitive tasks are related to making an optimal and rational decision.

        &#x20;
    5.  v.

        _Act_: Cognitive tasks are related to actions that the computer can take (automation) on its own based on insights and decisions.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    We then break down the outcomes into needs and requirements.

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="727" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-7 </p></figcaption></figure>

There are several tools to perform a _need understanding_, such as

* _Buying_ _journey map_: Mapping the process where the customers go through their way toward purchasing the product**.**
* _Building in public_: Building a product or service with the audience and potential customers to understand their needs and wants.
* _Feedback forms_: A method of asking users for feedback about your products and services right after using them.
* _Pre-order test_: This is a validation method where the customers can buy a product that has not yet been released or produced. Customers can even be charged with a deposit or full payment for a non-existing product.
* _Questionnaire_: A mass survey to ask what people think about your products and services before you even start advertising them. Usually, this method is followed by a conjoint testing method.
* _User interview_: A method of interviewing users to gather their needs and validate product and feature ideas.
* _Prototyping_: A validation method to build a preliminary model of a product to test users’ needs and the reaction of users toward proposed product features. In an AI-related product, a prototype must meet the Minimum Algorithmic Performance (MAP) or the minimum level of accurate intelligence required to justify real-world adoption while solving business problems.
* _User persona analysis_: A validation method to understand more about individual persona and their motivation.
* _UX testing_: A validation method to get people in front of your product and watch their behavior and reaction to the product.

#### Discovery of Needs

Ideally, as product developers, we know the customers’ needs before they ask. This can be accomplished by using _need discovery_. There are several tools to perform a _need discovery_. Some example tools are

* _Demand profit pool_: A market segmentation method to organize customers into groups based on the demand and profitability they want to satisfy.
* _Value chain analysis_: A method of evaluating each of the activities in a company’s value chain to understand how AI-driven software can improve them.
* _Value curve analysis_: A method of comparing products on a range of factors by rating them on a scale from low to high to define propositions against that of a competitor or industry norms.
* _Ethnographic research_: A market research method that originates from anthropology studies of users in real-life scenarios in their business process and industry.
* _Conjoint test_: A form of statistical analysis to understand how customers value different components or features of the product and services. This can help with pricing, marketing, and feature development strategy.
* _Context map canvas_: A tool to understand the world around our business and team, which we have zero control over. It is an excellent strategic tool for understanding competition, major trends, technology advancements, regulations, uncertainties, and customers’ desires.
* _Scenario planning_: A method to identify a specific set of uncertainties and possible realities of what might happen related to your industry in the future.
* _PESTLE analysis_: A framework used to gain a macro picture of an industry, especially on the political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors that may impact the industry, and identify risk factors.

_Discovering_ needs is different from _understanding_ needs. In the latter, the needs are already recognized by the customers. Several methods for understanding needs are feedback forms, questionnaires and user interviews, and MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which we already learned in the previous section. The outcome is tactical requirements, defined as requirements that can guarantee the business will run and the customer will be happy now. In comparison, discovering needs is more about predicting the customer’s needs or the market shifts in the future. The outcome is strategic requirements, defined as requirements that anticipate the customer’s needs in the future and have the potential to grow the business.

To use every need discovery tool described earlier, we need to understand that the discovery of needs is also divided into two different categories:

* _Customer focus_: Know customers better than themselves and predict what they need before telling us.
* _Market focus_: Anticipate the market’s overall direction and predict the shift or disruption in the market.

Each discovery tool mentioned earlier has a specific use, as shown in Figure [5-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="878" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-8 </p></figcaption></figure>

To understand or discover the customer’s needs, the product manager must collaborate with other teams to gather insights. The collaborators are

* _Support team_: The feedback from the support team as a team closest to the user is valuable to get a sense of UI/UX and list down quality issues such as bugs and performance gaps.
* _Engineering team_: The feedback on the latest technology, integration methods, reducing TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), and infrastructure efficiency.
* _AI/data science team_: The feedback are the most accurate algorithms and efficient data and AI model pipeline.
* _Sales team_: The feedback is why and how the customers buy our products, competitors’ features, and prices.
* _Business development_: The feedback concerns product growth strategy and new target segments.
* _Marketing_: The feedbacks are business trends, competition, and product value perception.
* _Management_ _(VP and above)_: The feedback is high-level strategic information such as industry trends, competitor strategy, political situation, and investment landscape.

We can use many different tools described earlier and use them in collaboration with other teams (Table [5-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)).Table 5-2&#x20;

After performing need discovery and understanding, we will do product requirements analysis and prioritization.

#### Translating Needs to Requirements

After collaborating with other stakeholders to gather needs, the product manager must translate them into requirements. This is difficult because each stakeholder has unique vocabulary and terminologies, and the product manager must also understand them.

For example, the end user will discuss user experiences such as UI design, workflow, and outcomes. In contrast, developer users will discuss developer experiences (DX), such as API structure, documentation, and development sandbox. The AI and data science team will speak about AI-related matters such as machine learning model accuracy, precision, recall, and the uncertainty monitoring method.

As for the internal teams, the sales and business teams will talk about pricing and the sales pipeline. The engineering/AI team will speak about technical feasibilities, TCO, and the latest technology stacks to add product value.

The product manager needs to translate the _need,_ which is defined as a business challenge, pain, or business outcome expected from the user perspective, into _requirements_ defined as specifications to be understood by the internal team (engineering and AI).

Usually, the requirements are written into a PRD (Product Requirements Document), which will describe why and what. For example, a FinTech wishes an online credit default prediction feature to predict the possibility of credit default from potential customers (what). It will speed up the process and reduce risk (why).

### Product Requirements Analysis

In this section, we will learn how to define product requirements based on the needs of the customers using the tools we mentioned in the previous section. Product requirements analysis is a process to understand the requirements mapped out of the customer needs deeply.

#### Define Product Requirements

To define the product requirements, we must do these steps:

1.  1.Understand the requirements. We must understand why the customers require a particular requirement. We can use this 5W and 1H framework:

    * _Why_: The actual purpose of the requirement
    * _What_: The outcome for the user
    * _When_: The time and frequency of user usage
    * _Who_: The user persona
    * _Where_: The place of usage
    * _How_: Usage mechanism

    &#x20;
2.  2.Categorize the requirements into three types by analyzing the current and future market and technology landscapes (see Table [5-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3)):

    1.  a.

        _Tactical requirements_: Short-term requirements (one-year time horizon) address customers’ short-term business challenges. The tactical requirements related to AI usually solve the customers’ direct operational and revenue problems using classical methods such as regression and mathematical optimization.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Strategic requirements_: Near-long-term requirements (two to three years’ time horizon), which bring entirely new value to customers. They don’t explicitly request, and we must discover. More novel applied AI technologies from research institutions such as Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Facebook AI Research (FAIR) can usually be utilized for these strategic requirements.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Disruptive requirements_: A game-changer requirement (more than three years’ time horizon) will create a new market and new normal. This requirement will make the old way of doing things irrelevant. This requirement will also typically need a groundbreaking technology, such as a completely different AI paradigm still in the research phase.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3.After categorizing the requirements (tactical-strategic-disruptive), we create the three-year product roadmap based on the product lifecycle (Figure [5-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig9)):

    1.  a.

        Determine your current product stage based on your product’s sales revenue and the number of customers.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        If you are in an early stage of the product, validate the market and technology by focusing on the tactical requirements that solve the customer’s business challenges.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        If you are in an early growth stage, the market has been validated, and you are increasing the adoption rate. Focus on defining the tactical and strategic requirements for the next year proportionally (70% tactical and 30% strategic as a rule of thumb) using customer and market discovery tools in the previous section.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        If you are in a later growth stage, the market is growing rapidly, but many competitors arise. You must focus on the following year’s tactical, strategic, and disruptive requirements (70% tactical, 20% strategic, and 10% disruptive, as a rule of thumb).

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        If you are in a maturity stage, the market is already saturated. You should only focus on tactical requirements and start to realign resources to develop the new product.

        &#x20;
    6.  f.

        When you are in a decline stage, you are preparing to deprecate the product. You are no longer concerned about new requirements, only supporting current users until the product’s retirement announcement.

1.  4\.

    Based on the list of requirements and their category from the previous step, we must prioritize the requirements for the next year (four quarters).

    &#x20;

### Product Prioritization

We have learned how product managers can collaborate with several collaborators for customer understanding and discovery, anticipate a market shift, and even disrupt the market. After the product manager has gathered customer needs and translated them into requirements, we must prioritize them. A product roadmap is a top-down approach that evolves from product vision and consists of product purpose and objectives. In product prioritization, we will shift the discussion from requirements to features. Requirements outline customers’ needs that the product should address. Requirements allow engineers (developers and data scientists) to define how to address those needs by mapping the requirements into features (Figure [5-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6)).

#### Identification of Product Purpose and Product Objectives

The product vision is the product’s foundation, consisting of product purpose and objectives. Product purpose explains why the product exists and the product’s principle and value for the customers. Product objectives describe tangible values for the organization, such as

* Increase in market capitalization
* Expansion into a new market to align with market trends
* Development of new technology
* Increase in sales and revenue

We prioritize by identifying the right set of requirements that will accomplish the product objectives and remain aligned with the product vision.

#### From Product Objectives to Customer Values to Roadmap

The next important thing is defining customer values and aligning these with our product objectives. We must also consider the requirements we gathered from the users with various tools we learned from the previous section.

Based on the general framework depicted in Figure [5-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5) on defining the vision to prioritize the features for the short-term roadmap, we continue with more detailed steps as follows:

1.  1\.

    Define product vision, mission, and principles.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Define the objectives of the product.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    We define the themes based on the product objectives and the customer values we want to focus on in a year.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Break the product objectives down into product attributes that reflect the customer values.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    List the features aligned with the customer requirements gathered using various tools mentioned in the previous section for each product attribute.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    Weighting and prioritizing the features using the _scorecard system_ will be explained in the next section. Steps 2–6 are depicted in Figure [5-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig10).

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig10_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="479" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-10 </p></figcaption></figure>

#### Collaborative Weighted Scorecard Prioritization Method

There are several methods of product prioritization, such as the Kano model and RICE, but for a complex product such as AI-first SaaS, the prioritization method called the Collaborative Weighted Scorecard (CWS) method is arguably more relevant because of the following reasons:

1.  1\.

    In complex enterprise products employing innovative technology, attaining business value and technology feasibility is vital. We need a prioritization method that optimizes the balance between business value and effort to build the technology to satisfy business needs.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    The cost of feature R\&D for a deep tech–driven innovative startup is high; therefore, feature prioritization based on the trial and error method should be minimized. We must create a product strategy that aligns well with the developed features. Weighted scoring is an ideal prioritization methodology to align the features plan with the product strategy.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    It instills a sense of ownership due to collaborations between stakeholders. Business, engineering, AI/data science, product, and operations are working together to share perspectives and define needs, requirements, product attributes, feature weightings, and business values.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    It is quantitative and collaborative in nature, so it is more objective and minimizes HIPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) syndrome or pressure from the sales team.

    &#x20;

There are pros and cons to applying the Collaborative Weighted Scorecard for prioritization.

The pros are as follows:

* Better alignment and quantification of every stakeholder on product purpose, objectives, and strategies.
* Ensuring that feature prioritization is still in line with the product roadmap.
* The quantitative nature of the method provides a more rational and justified view of prioritizing product features.
* It works well on more complex enterprise products with a higher expectation of quality and governance.

The cons are as follows:

* It works best only if absolute clarity exists on what value and expectation to deliver to customers.
* Purely quantitative. It can mislead people to believe that the prioritization must be performed rigidly while actually not. Prioritization is a combination of qualitative and quantitative endeavors.
* Not suitable for a novel product where the market is not validated yet and quick agility to changes is needed.
* Basic features (must-haves) will never be scored high on the value index; hence, we must identify the basic features first.

The steps of how to do collaborative prioritization using a weighted scorecard are as follows:

1.  1\.

    Define the weights of each product attribute.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Measure the value of each feature against product attributes on a scale of 1–10.

    &#x20;
3. 3.Measure the cost of each feature on a scale of 1–10 with the following formula:![\$$ Cost= Man\  Weeks\ Needed\ x\ \frac{100}{Man\  Weeks\ of\ the\ Most\ Complex\ Festure} \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equa.png)&#x20;
4.  4\.

    Group the value of the feature vs. cost in a 2 × 2 prioritization matrix.

    &#x20;
5. 5.Calculate the features using absolute value by using the following formula:![\$$ Absolute\ Value=\frac{Total\ Value\ of\ Feature\ x}{Cost\ of\ Feature\ x} \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equb.png)&#x20;
6.  6\.

    Rank the features by absolute value to determine the priority.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    If necessary, combine with other prioritization methods such as Kano or RICE.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    Decide the features to be developed for a particular time horizon.

    &#x20;

### Measuring the Efficacy of the Product Roadmap

A product roadmap is an incredibly critical element that determines the success of a product and even business sustainability. Consequently, the product manager must periodically measure the efficacy of the product roadmap. The effectiveness measurement is to see the impact of the roadmap on the product objectives.

The product manager should examine whether the product is on the right path to accomplish product objectives. It means they need to answer the following questions:

* Do we pick the right product attributes and weights?
* Do we pick the right features that deliver real customer values?
* Does delivering customer value have an impact on product objectives?

We can use the tool called Feature Usage Metrics, which is a tool to measure features and customer values.

The steps to building Feature Usage Metrics are as follows (see Figure [5-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig11)):

1.  1\.

    Pick the top-ranked features we gather from the last release of the roadmap.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Identify their usage. We can use product analytics software or user interview to collect this data.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Features with top ranks presumably delivered more value to the customers and were used more.

    &#x20;
4.  4.If customers do not utilize the top-ranked features, then we need to answer these two questions:

    1.  a.

        Are customers aware of these features?

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Do these features address real needs?

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    If the answer to the preceding two questions is yes, we must revisit product attributes and weightings.

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: DEVELOPING PRODUCT STRATEGY FOR SMARTCONCIERGE

After Sarah and Carlos successfully validated their AI concierge Product-Market-Technology (P-M-T) fit by building AI consulting for the hospitality business, they are now ready to go to the next phase, creating a product strategy for their AI startup. Creating a product strategy enables them to plan ahead of their startup’s direction, which benefits not only the founders but also the employees and potential/existing investors. They follow the _five-step product strategy lifecycle framework_ described in this chapter.

**Step 1: Product Visioning and Objectives.** They prepare product vision and objectives, leading to a roadmap for the next four quarters (one year). Sarah defines the product vision of their AI concierge startup: SmartConcierge, as follows (Figure [5-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig12)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig12_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="975" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-12 </p></figcaption></figure>

Sarah and her team approach the product roadmap from two sides, top-down and bottom-up (Figure [5-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig13)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_5_Chapter/522265_1_En_5_Fig13_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1443" width="1004"><figcaption><p>Figure 5-13 </p></figcaption></figure>

The top-down approach defines product objectives as follows:

* Improve revenue.
* Increase growth.

After clearly stating product objectives, they define customer values or expected outcomes along with the timeline.

**Step 2:** **Product Discovery.** Based on various customer validation tools, the team decides on two themes that deliver customer values that will help the revenue improvement:

* Increase hotel customer engagement. Because the revenue primarily comes from hotels, there should be a way to engage them more.
* Improve product quality. This will help improve the hotel guest’s trust; hence, the hotel decision-maker will also be more engaged.

One customer value will help with market growth: acquiring new markets other than hotels, such as Airbnb owners and coworking spaces.

The customer values are then mapped into product attributes (Table [5-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab4)). The product attributes are given weights to mark their importance relative to customer values.Table 5-4&#x20;

Product Objective-Customer Value-Product Attribute-Weight

| Product Objectives           | Themes/Customer Values                            | Product Attributes        | Weights |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Improve revenue              | <p>Increase</p><p>hotel engagement</p>            | Customer onboarding       | 2       |
| Hotel customer satisfaction  | 2                                                 |                           |         |
| Hotel customer safety        | 1.5                                               |                           |         |
| Ancillary revenue            | 1                                                 |                           |         |
| Improve product quality      | Robust systems                                    | 1                         |         |
| Informative system           | 0.5                                               |                           |         |
| Increase market growth       | Penetrate coworking space and Airbnb owner market | Hardware interoperability | 1       |
| Integration with marketplace | 1                                                 |                           |         |

In parallel, the bottom-up approach is also performed by defining the market’s needs and then translating them into requirements.

The requirements are gathered using different requirement-gathering tools explained in a previous section, as depicted in Table [5-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab4).

**Step 3: Requirements Analysis**. The team then analyzes the requirements mapped from the market needs and market discoveries by 5W1H analysis. Based on the requirements, they now have a list of tactical, strategic, and disruptive features. The list of tactical features that will be developed for the next year is then tabulated and scored against the weights of each product attribute.

**Step 4: Product Prioritization**. The team performs feature scoring based on the customer values (see Table [5-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5)). Then they multiply the scores with the weights of each attribute to get feature values as follows.Table 5-5&#x20;

Scoring the Features Based on Customer Values

| No.   | Feature                                     | <p>Hotel Customer Onboarding</p><p>(Weight: 2)</p> | <p>Hotel Customer</p><p>Satisfaction</p><p>(Weight: 2)</p> | … | Customer Value Score |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | - | -------------------- |
| **1** | Room booking bot                            | 10 x 2 = 20                                        | 8 x 2 = 16                                                 | … | 49.5                 |
| **2** | Integration with hotel reservation software | 9 x 2 = 18                                         | 8 x 2 = 16                                                 | … | 52.5                 |
| **3** | ID verification and matching                | 9 x 2 = 18                                         | 7 x 2 = 14                                                 | … | 62                   |
| **4** | Guest face enrollment                       | 8 x 2 = 16                                         | 8 x 2 = 14                                                 | … | 65                   |
| **…** | …                                           | …                                                  | …                                                          | … | …                    |

Then calculate the feature cost by the following equation:![\$$ Cost= Man\  Weeks\ Needed\ x\ \frac{100}{Man\  Weeks\ of\ the\ Most\ Complex\ Festure} \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equc.png)The most complex feature is predicted to be completed in 20 weeks. The feature costs are tabulated as follows (Table [5-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab6)).Table 5-6&#x20;

The team then plots the customer value vs. feature cost (effort), as shown in Table [5-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab7), and then plots it in the prioritization graph (Figure [5-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig14)).

* _Quadrant IV_ (high customer value, low feature cost): This is low-hanging fruit where the outcome is optimal with minimal effort. These are highly likely features to be developed.
* _Quadrant III_ (high customer value, high feature cost): This feature is developed if it can be a strong differentiator/delighter.
* _Quadrant II_ (low customer value, low feature cost): This feature is developed if it is a must-have feature.
* _Quadrant I_ (low customer value, high feature cost): This feature should not be developed.

The team plots the customer value vs. feature cost in the prioritization graph (Figure [5-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig14)).

Based on the preceding prioritization graph, the SmartConcierge team prioritizes the features as follows:

* Guest face enrollment (F4)
* Integration with the Bluetooth/NFC door lock system (F6)
* Integration with hotel reservation software (F1)
* Room upgrade/upsell bot (F5)
* ID verification and matching (F3)
* Etc.

Then they divide the features to be developed in the Q1–Q4 roadmap.

**Step 5. Roadmap Efficacy Evaluation**. After the features on the roadmap are successfully implemented, the team continually validates the market and analyzes the feature usage using Feature Audit Matrix (Figure [5-15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_5\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig15)). Many users should have frequently used the highly ranked features 1–10 as possible (which positively correlated with product objectives); otherwise, they must review their market needs, discovery, requirements, and prioritization processes.

#### Ten Sins of AI Product Roadmapping

When building an AI product roadmap, we have to avoid the ten most common mistakes:

1.  1\.

    _Prioritizing requirements based on the latest AI hype_: It is tempting to build requirements based on the latest untested but trendy AI methods fresh out of R\&D labs. Technical AI product people are prone to this tendency.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Prioritizing elusive requirements that are not feasible technologically_: AI products help humans automate or augment decision-making by replicating cognitive systems. Selecting far-fetched requirements that only happen in sci-fi movies is sometimes enticing.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Prioritizing requirements based on revenue potential_: It is natural to focus on requirements with higher revenue potential. After all, revenue is the reason a product exists. But obsessing over the revenue aspect only causes us to lose sight of the long-term objectives.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Prioritizing requirements of biggest_ _customers_: The big company name in your customer list is significant in enterprise products. They may also contribute to the revenue, but unless your company is a consulting/service provider, focus on requirements that will satisfy the majority of your customers.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Prioritizing requirements concurring with technical teams_: In a tech-dominated organization such as an AI startup, technical people like software engineers and AI specialists have a powerful influence and power to dominate in defining and prioritizing requirements. This should be avoided by focusing on requirements with maximum customer values first instead of technical team preference.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Prioritizing requirements of the end user only instead of the buyer_: In an enterprise product, the end user and the buyer are two different people. For product managers, getting end user feedback is easier than for the buyer because there are many usage analytics tools and opportunities to interact with end users. But product managers also need to balance requirements prioritization by listening and gathering insights from the buyer or the decision-maker of the product.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _Prioritizing requirements without common themes_: The theme with customer value as output unifies the requirements for a particular period. The themes are the underlying how-to of product objectives. With themes, it is easier to define product attributes.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    _Prioritizing requirements based on the pressures of the business team_: The business team is an essential team that communicates regularly with customers and usually acts as a customer’s voice. But the business team has different KPIs from the product team, such as revenue and sales. So they are motivated to pressure the product team to deliver the customer’s requirements with more significant revenue potential. This conflicts with the product manager’s goal: to create a product with optimal value to as many customers as possible. The product manager must also align customer requirements directly with the whole product strategy.

    &#x20;
9.  9\.

    _Prioritizing requirements based on what competitors are doing_: Watching what competitors are doing is necessary, but we should not establish our prioritization on competitors’ features to check the box. Instead, we should focus on customer needs. We must use competitors’ products as a benchmark and learn from them, but not blindly develop things they have been building.

    &#x20;
10. 10\.

    _Prioritizing requirements based on the request of management_: It is common in any organization to accommodate the requirements defined by top-level management. But a good product manager must always challenge the management request with market and customer data and align their request with the whole product objectives and roadmap.

    &#x20;

### Conclusion

This chapter teaches about building product strategies for enterprise AI products. There is no rigid methodology for product strategy. We only provide a guidance or framework, which we think is the best for such complex products.

Building product strategy through a clearly defined roadmap is crucial for product success regardless of whether a particular product has an AI on it or not. The product roadmap starts by defining a high-level product vision, including objectives, missions, and beliefs. The product vision must always align with the customer and market needs. A product roadmap continuously evolves with changes in user needs and behavior, technological advancement, and business conditions. A product manager must always collaborate with multiple stakeholders to validate the tactical, strategic, and disruptive requirements through the market, business, technical, operational, and financial aspects.

Ultimately, a good product roadmap will deliver optimal customer value, eventually sustaining the company’s business.

### Key Takeaways

* Product strategy defines what a product must achieve and how to achieve it.
* A product roadmap is an outline of product strategy from product vision to requirements to features for a particular timeframe.
* The five-step product strategy framework consists of product visioning, discovery, requirements analysis, prioritization, and evaluation of roadmap efficacy.
* A product roadmap has different audiences, internal and external.
* A product roadmap must adapt to changes in the business world.
* Product vision consists of product objectives, missions, and principles.
* We can use the SETDA (Sense, Explain, Think, Decide, Act) framework to determine customer needs for AI products.
* There are several tools to perform _need understanding_ and _discovery_.
* The product manager must collaborate with other stakeholders for _discovery_ and mapping needs into requirements and prioritization.
* A product lifecycle has four states: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.
* The requirements must be categorized into tactical, strategic, and disruptive based on their state in the product lifecycle.
* The requirements must be mapped into features and categorized into themes with customer values as outcomes.
* The Collaborative Weighted Scorecard prioritization method is suitable for enterprise AI products with heavy R\&D and innovation.
* We can measure the efficacy of the product roadmap by using a method such as Feature Usage Metrics.
