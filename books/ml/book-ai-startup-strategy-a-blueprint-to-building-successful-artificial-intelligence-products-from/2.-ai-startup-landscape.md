# 2. AI Startup Landscape

In the previous chapter, we built a conceptual understanding of the fundamental of AI techniques and their applications, the foundation of AI startups, and how AI helps enterprises become AI-first companies.

In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the fascinating landscape of AI startups, exploring the vast array of business models and monetization strategies that are used to turn cutting-edge AI technology into profitable and sustainable business ventures. We’ll begin by taking a closer look at the specific problems that AI startups seek to solve and examining how these solutions fit within the broader context of the enterprise. From there, we’ll delve into the critical role played by AI product managers (APMs) in driving innovation and success within these startups.

We’ll also explore some of the most common AI business models, including those focused on developing AI-powered products or providing AI-powered services. By understanding these business models and how to exploit the unique value proposition (UVP) of AI within the company value chain, entrepreneurs and product managers can unlock new opportunities for growth and success.

Finally, we’ll look at the intriguing AI startup valuation and acquisition world. Building a successful AI startup is a challenging and often unpredictable endeavor. Still, those who can achieve it can reap tremendous rewards through lucrative buyouts and acquisitions. We’ll explore the various factors that can impact an AI startup’s value and examine successful AI entrepreneurs’ strategies to maximize their chances of securing a profitable exit.

### What Problems Do AI Startups Solve?

Developing AI solutions in-house is costly and time-consuming. Developing AI solutions requires significant investment in infrastructure, data collection, data annotation, subject matter experts (SMEs), and AI experts. Acquiring the necessary knowledge and experience to develop AI solutions effectively can take time and effort. Many companies may underestimate the costs associated with these factors.

An AI startup does precisely this. AI startups build and provide off-the-shelf AI solutions that customers can easily consume and integrate without an AI expert, eventually providing instant business value for them, all without requiring the services of an entire IT team to manage the necessary infrastructure, updating, validating, and deploying the AI model continuously. To deliver this, AI startups need to understand how to frame the problems and needs of their target customers and then build standardized AI solutions that will perform immediately in the most common scenarios.

The AI product properly done could provide incredible business benefits for customers. But AI startups should do a deep analysis of how their AI product can be customized and complemented with services to solve a variety of problems of their customers because, fundamentally, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for AI products.

### The Role of an AI Product Manager

A product manager is a multidisciplinary individual who identifies:

* What product to build
* When to build it
* Why it needs to be built

The product manager must understand their customers’ needs, pain, gain, and goals and what excites them and then prioritize what needs to be done.

The role of a product manager is relatively recent, around 25 years. There is even a new product manager, an AI product manager (APM; see Figure [2-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). The AI product manager is focused on managing products that utilize AI algorithms as their core value proposition, not only for complementing or optimizing the product. As a central figure in any AI startup, an AI product manager is focused on managing products that utilize AI algorithms. The AI product manager will lead the vision, considering the data availability, measuring the AI algorithm feasibility to solve real business problems, facilitating the collaborations between AI scientists and engineers, listening to the customer, and driving adoption and growth measured by business metrics.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1060" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

In an AI startup where AI is the core product, it is mandatory for a product manager to deeply understand how AI works, along with the base platform’s architectural design and its limitation.

The field of AI, especially machine learning–related algorithms, is probabilistic and non-deterministic by nature. The main problem with AI is edge cases and unexplainable mistakes, although now a new trend is coming, the XAI (_explainable AI_).

Even a very comprehensive stress test doesn’t guarantee that the AI systems will perform satisfactorily 100% all the time.

Due to edge cases that will certainly happen, AI product managers must regularly discuss revising the foundational design of the AI algorithms and the platform architecture, such as deep learning model architecture. Therefore, the AI product manager must be extremely technical because they will communicate intensively with AI engineers, data scientists, developers, and testers for highly complex problems.

The following is the reason for the complexity of AI product development:

The goal of the AI solution is to replicate human cognitive systems by giving an output (prediction, recognition, or insights) given an input (image, video, text, speech), so head-to-head comparison with human perception (which itself is different from human to human) is somehow an intuitive thing to do, but it is wrong. It is not uncommon to hear a complaint from AI product users such as “How can the AI not \[recognize/understand] the \[object/speech/text]? It is extremely clear for ME.” Comparing human-made AI systems with the human brain resulting from millions of years of evolution is certainly a fallacy. The task of visual recognition, including the ability to spot objects such as wolves (Figure [2-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)), is one that has been historically difficult for both human and artificial intelligence. Even the human visual system can struggle with identifying certain objects, and the limitations of AI are sometimes also attributed to its reliance on datasets that are themselves curated and labeled by humans.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="417" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

* AI product development is not only about developing robust algorithms and platforms but also developing robust end-to-end processes of data acquisition, annotation, model development, and deployment with failover mechanisms and feedback loops.
* Since an AI product is usually located in one abstraction layer and integrated with other software-based products, an AI product is mainly consumed and/or integrated by a technical person such as a developer. Therefore, understanding DX (_developer experience_), including the REST API and microservices, SOA (service-oriented architecture), SDK (Software Development Kit) design, and SQL/RDBMS concept, is essential for the AI product manager who will design the AI product and documentation.
* Due to AI’s nature, which involves the acquisition and processing of unstructured and structured data, AI product development involves quite complex architectural design. The foundation of architectural software design is necessary for AI product managers.
* Understand how the metrics of AI performance (i.e., _ROC_, _AUC_, _precision, and recall_) will relate to business performance. This would need a thorough understanding of statistical and business analysis.
* Understand how the metrics of business performance (i.e., cost saving, profit) will correlate with the overall improvement of the business process and the financial improvement (i.e., _ROI_, _payback period_).

Therefore, an AI product manager must deeply understand:

* How AI and the human cognitive systems work
* AI process design and operationalization
* How developers think (developer experience-DX)
* Architectural design and software development of a data-intensive platform
* Statistical analysis
* Business analysis

### AI Startup Business Model

A business model is defined as a plan for how the business identifies the sources of revenue and target market, which will affect the operations, product architecture, and organization design.

AI startups have a unique business model different from SaaS (Software as a Service). The main difference between AI startups and SaaS startup is that AI startups always need data, huge computing power, and complex algorithms. An AI company is innately more difficult to understand for customers than SaaS company and solves different problems. SaaS digitizes manual processes performed by humans, and AI automates decisions or generates insights from a huge amount of data previously generated by humans and information systems. The implication is that AI technology must be sold, monetized, and operated differently.

There are two major landscapes of AI companies:

1.  1._Horizontal AI startups (AI as a Service)_: This type of AI company helps developers and data scientists develop and deploy AI for their products. These AI companies can be categorized by their products:

    1.  a.

        _AI platform_: An end-to-end computational platform from data acquisition and annotation to ML model training and deployment. The end-to-end computational platform examples are AWS Sagemaker, IBM Watson, DataRobot, Azure Machine Learning, and Google Cloud AI Platform.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _AI tool_: The tools to develop AI models, for example, a tool for machine learning model monitoring, data annotation, XAI, etc. Examples of AI tools are Dataiku (MLOps and DataOps platform), Scale.ai (data platform), Iguazio (MLOps platform), Neptune AI (ML experiment management), Fiddler AI (machine learning monitoring), Super AI (automatic data annotation), and Modzy (ModelOps and MLOps platform).

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _AI engine_: AI models such as machine learning, deep learning, or decision optimization that are packaged as a service and can be accessed through REST API or SDK. The examples are Deepgram (Speech Recognition as a Service), Trueface (Face Recognition as a Service), Routific (Route Optimization as a Service), and OpenALPR (License Plate Recognition as a Service).

        &#x20;

    Therefore, the users of horizontal AI startups are generally data scientists or developers in tech companies or different industry verticals. The business model they use is generally based on subscriptions.

    &#x20;
2.  2._Vertical AI startups_: These AI companies develop AI solutions for specific use cases. They sell to the business end user in a particular industry (B2B) or end user (B2C). Vertical AI can be categorized further:

    1.  a.

        _AI-powered SaaS_: This is a traditional B2B SaaS empowered with AI to complement their core solutions (i.e., for sales forecasting or optimization of sales visits). The examples are HubSpot (CRM SaaS powered by AI) and Xero (accounting SaaS powered by AI).

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _AI-first SaaS_: A type of B2B SaaS that could not function without AI at its core. The examples are Affectiva (AI SaaS to understand human emotion), Avoma (AI-based meeting assistant), Jumio (AI-based biometrics verification), and Locus (AI-based logistics planning and optimization).

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Consumer AI_: An AI-powered product for consumers. Examples are mobile applications such as FaceApp (face transformation app), iRobot (consumer robot), Jarvis (AI-based copywriting software), and Deep Sentinel (AI-based security cameras).

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

Each type of AI startup also has a monetization model. The typical monetization models of AI startups (Figure [2-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)) are:

1.  1\.

    _Customization + license (high-touch deployment)_: In this model, the customers are paying for AI model customization, integration, and deployment. After that, they can pay for the licensing fee for AI model usage and maintenance. This AI solution can be deployed on the customer’s premises. Because of the intensive customization, integration, and deployment, the drawback is the sales cycle is long, but the benefit is the AI company can charge a larger amount of money, and usually, once the customer has the AI systems all set up, it is more likely for the customer to keep using the services.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Subscription/pay per use (low-touch deployment)_: This is based on the SaaS business model, where the AI company will charge the customer a monthly or yearly fee or charge per usage of the AI applications. The AI as a Service can be integrated with customers’ systems and consumed using a REST API or SDK mechanism. The AI solution accesses data flowing through the systems and processes the data on the cloud or the device, fueling business insights and decision improvement/automation. The benefit of this monetization model is it is fast to deploy, so the sales cycle is quick. However, this is also a very fragile model. If the AI solution does not fulfill the expectation of the customer, it can cause the customer to churn. AI as a Service must provide a robust generalized AI service that gives customers good ROI (return on investment).

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Unit based_: This is a monetization model of a startup that creates AI as a part of the product like security cameras, consumer robots, or autonomous cars. They sell by unit sold.

    &#x20;

The preceding monetization models can be combined to attain the optimal revenue for the AI startup.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="682" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

### The Business Value Within the Value Chain

One of the reasons AI is important to enterprise business is the possibility of scaling up the value chain by automating decision-making processes (see Figure [2-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)). Scaling up the value chain allows companies to grow and gain various benefits, from increasing operational effectiveness to enabling new revenue streams. The following diagram shows four main areas to scale the value chain using AI and their example. The SETDA decision-making framework must be applied to some (or every) activity in the value chain, resulting in business value improvement, which the return on investment and payback period (PBP) can justify.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="707" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

The SETDA loop implemented in value chain activities can potentially improve one or more of the following business values:

* _Optimizing operational efficiency_: AI can be used to maximize the efficiency of operations and improve production throughput, resulting in reduced operating costs. Examples of applications are production scheduling, predictive maintenance, intelligent supply chain and inventory optimization, automated defect inspection, automated logistic routing, and data center energy optimization.
* _Managing risk_: We can build an AI solution to analyze a stream of real-time data or a massive amount of stored data and then forecast the risk or even detect anomalies indicating a system breach. Example applications are fraud transaction detection, credit and insurance risk assessment and management, document assessment, cyberattack prevention, and IT audit.
* _Increasing revenue_: The AI can be used for applications that help increase revenue and profits, such as churn prevention, dynamic pricing, recommendation systems, CRM, ads targeting, and credit scoring.
* _Improving customer experience_: AI can help with tasks related to customer handling and improving customer satisfaction, such as a customer service chatbot and meeting scheduler.

So basically, the AI solution only has two benefits:

* _Hard/tangible benefits_: Reducing cost or improving revenue
* _Soft/intangible benefits_: Reducing risk, improving satisfaction

AI product managers must understand how to position their AI solutions in the value chain. Their AI solution must provide optimal business value for their customer in that particular value chain. The next chapter will discuss how to analyze AI in the value chain.

### The Business Value of an AI Product

Despite the hype surrounding AI technology, selling AI products to companies can be challenging. The ultimate goal of any business is to optimize value, whether through cost savings or revenue enhancement. As such, it is crucial to quantify the value of AI products and initiatives. However, this process is often more of an art than a science, requiring a nuanced understanding of the specific business needs and context.

Effectively measuring the KPI and value of AI products is a universal challenge for all AI startups. But this is the first thing that the AI startups must do, even before developing any AI product. They need to make sure that their AI product

1.  1\.

    _Gets the job done_: Proven to help the customer achieve the concrete result by the decision automation and prediction of the AI, for example, predicting creditworthiness accurately, scheduling staff and equipment efficiently, and forecasting churning customers accurately

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Has a tangible AI value that is sensible and quantifiable for the customers, which in return will lead to proper pricing

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Can contribute to additional intangible benefits, such as risk reduction, faster decisions, happier employees, etc.

    &#x20;

So basically, the value of AI is the perception of \[ (tangible value + intangible value) x % of the job that gets done].

What is a tangible AI value? If we look into the customer perspective, especially in the B2B landscape, the final decision-maker of any technology solution is the finance guy, that is, CFO, finance manager, and financial controllers. These guys only need to know two things:

> _“Is it worth it?” and “How long until I recover my investment?”_

There are only two widely used financial metrics to answer those questions: ROI (return on investment) and PBP (payback period).

ROI is a return from an investment in a certain period (time horizon).

PBP is the time needed until we recover our investment.

The general guidelines for measuring the value of AI products are as follows:

* Focus on measuring tangible benefits first, which are ROI and PBP. Determine the ROI, which is the investment (all costs included) vs. gains for a period of time:![\$$ ROI=\frac{Gains- Investment}{Investment}x\ 100\\% \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equa.png)

\- Gains = Cost saving or revenue generated

\- Investment = Data Operation Cost + Integration Cost + Subscription Cost

The gains must be exhaustively listed, including the cost of human reduction and the value from the prediction, optimization, or automation itself.

Then, determine the PBP, which is![\$$ PBP=\frac{Investment}{Gains}. \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equb.png)

* List intangible benefits, such as fewer risks, reduced turnovers, happier employees, happier customers, fewer errors, faster decisions, reduced cognitive loads, etc.
* Factor the benefits of building an AI-ready culture.

CASE STUDY: CALCULATE BUSINESS VALUEAutomatic dispatch and route optimization based on AI, that is, Onfleet ([www.onfleet.com](http://www.onfleet.com/)), Optitrax ([www.optitrax.co](http://www.optitrax.co/)), or Locus ([www.locus.sh](http://www.locus.sh/)), are SaaS helping logistic companies optimize fleet route and dispatch orders to their couriers. To make a solid business case that justifies business values, they must consider quantified potential gains such as

* _The reduction of_ _human dispatchers_: The AI system allows the number of human dispatchers to be reduced. Therefore, the monthly compensation of human dispatchers can be reduced.
* _The_ _reduced cost of fuel_: The more optimized route resulted in reduced fuel costs for all fleets.
*   _The_ _reduced cost of couriers’ overtime_: The more optimized route resulted in reduced overtime for all couriers.

    So the total annual gains = (salary of human dispatcher replaced + fuel cost reduction + reduction of couriers’ overtime per month) x 12.

We also need to calculate the total investment, which is

* _Cost of data operation development_: A new AI system will always need a data operation (DataOps), an automated way of acquiring data and improving data quality for analytics purposes.
* _Cost of system integration_: Any AI system must be integrated with current infrastructures, and the cost is inevitable.
* _Model training and evaluation cost_: Any sufficiently complex AI system, like a route optimization system, needs continuous model training to perform its best.
* _Subscription cost_: The monthly subscription cost.

Let’s estimate the cost savings and break it down (Table [2-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 2-1&#x20;

Cost Saving Estimate

| Gain from Cost Saving (Monthly)                         | Amount ($) |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Human dispatcher compensation (1 person x $2,500/month) | 2,500      |
| Fuel cost                                               | 3,000      |
| Courier overtime                                        | 2,000      |
| Total                                                   | 7,500      |

Now we estimate the investment needed for one year (Table [2-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)).Table 2-2&#x20;

Investment Needed for One Year

| Investment (Yearly)                               | Amount ($) |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| DataOps development cost                          | 5,000      |
| Training cost                                     | 5,000      |
| Integration cost                                  | 6,000      |
| Subscription cost ($4,000 monthly x 12 = $48,000) | 48,000     |
| Total                                             | 64,000     |

From the preceding table, we can do a back-of-the-envelope yearly ROI estimation using route optimization and a dispatch system:![\$$ One\  Year\  ROI=\frac{One\  Year\ Gains- One\  Year\ Investment}{One\  Year\ Investment}x\ 100\\% \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equc.png)![\$$ One\  Year\  ROI=\frac{\left(\\$7,500\ x\ 12\right)-\\$64,000}{\\$64,000}x\ 100\\% \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equd.png)![\$$ One\  Year\  ROI=\frac{\left(\\$90,000\right)-\\$64,000}{\\$64,000}x\ 100\\%=41\\% \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Eque.png)

So one year ROI is 41%, which is a fantastic number.

How about the payback period (PBP)? Let’s calculate:![\$$ PBP=\frac{Total\ Investment}{One\  Month\ Gains} \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equf.png)![\$$ PBP=\frac{DataOps\ Cost+ Training\ Cost+ Integration\ Cost}{Monthly\ Cost\ Saving- Monthly\ Subscription} \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equg.png)![\$$ PBP=\frac{\\$5,000+\\$5,000+\\$6,000}{\\$7,500-\\$4,000}=\frac{\\$16,000}{\\$3,500}=4.5\  months \$$](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter\_TeX\_Equh.png)

The payback period is only 4.5 months to recoup the initial investment, which is fantastic. So the _one year_ ROI of 41% and payback period of 4.5 months are like music to the customer’s ears.

This is an example of how an AI company should justify its tangible value. Financial justification like this, however rudimentary, would be a determining factor for an AI company from the business and investment standpoint. After the tangible metrics have been defined and presented to the customer, then intangible metrics or more abstract metrics such as extended vehicle’s _Remaining Useful Life_ (RUL), improved courier’s mental health, increased customer’s satisfaction, and fleet manager’s reduced cognitive loads can be pitched to the customer.

### Understanding the Valuation of AI Startups

The AI startup can be categorized as a deep tech company in the early days. _Deep tech_ is coined in certain cutting-edge sectors such as bio robotics, quantum computing, genetic engineering, blockchain, advanced material, and space exploration.

Deep tech companies are usually started by very technical or scientific people and circle around innovative technology. Often, practicality and business applications are not the main concern of the founders.

There are generally three company valuation approaches:

* _Market approach_: Determining the company’s value based on the selling price of similar assets
* _Income approach_: Determining the company’s value based on the future projection of revenue by taking into account the past and current revenues
* _Asset approach_: Determining the company’s value by total business assets (tangible and intangible) and then subtracting its liabilities

The asset approach is the most suitable to be applied to the valuation of deep tech companies, including AI companies that are pre-revenue with minimal or negative cash flows and cannot generate a clear return on investment in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the fair market value of the IP (_intellectual property_; patents), how the future holds for the technology (use cases, monetization model), data, and the founders’ credibility will form the basis of the valuation. But overtime, AI solutions are starting to be democratized and adopted by different industry verticals. AI has also become part of any hardware or software product, from smart speakers to SaaS. Therefore, the valuation increasingly resembles the SaaS valuation, which is heavily toward the income approach. Hence, scalability becomes an important part here.

To have a reasonable valuation, an AI startup must provide significant business value for an industry with a fair market size. They must also have robust technology and data moats as well as scalability (see Figure [2-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

### AI Startup Acquisitions

AI companies prefer one particular exit plan, which is getting acquired. The prevalence of AI startup acquisitions has doubled since 2016 and increased by an average of 46% in the following years. Tech giants like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Intel, Google, and Uber dominate startup acquisitions.

Non-tech Fortune 500 companies are also aggressively acquiring AI startups. Examples are McDonald’s (acquires speech recognition Apprente and AI-based personalization platform Dynamic Yield), General Electric (acquires industrial AI startup Wise and Bit Stew), General Dynamics (acquires autonomous driving startup Cruise Automation and Momenta), Hewlett-Packard (acquires distributed machine learning startup Determined AI), and Walmart (acquires natural language processing startup Aspectiva).

Companies acquire other companies to build on the strengths and weaknesses of the acquiring company. This method is also known as business acquisition or business takeover. Through this process, one company takes control of the interest and management of a targeted company.

Before deciding to acquire other companies, a company’s management team needs to analyze the strategic match between the acquirer and acquired companies.

There are many reasons tech companies acquire AI companies:

1.  1\.

    _Long-term bet_: To accelerate the growth of the overall business. Examples are Google (acquires DeepMind), Amazon (acquires Zoox), and Microsoft (acquires Lobe).

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Strengthening the_ _core AI platform_: Enhancing existing AI capability. Examples are Tesla (acquires DeepScale), ServiceNow (acquires Element AI and Loom Systems), Skyfii (acquires CrowdVision), and SAP (acquires Qualtrics).

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Acquiring talents_: Recruiting the best AI team with proven products and capability to acquire tacit and technical knowledge.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Acquiring credentials_: Obtain credentials such as ISO, standard, permit, certification, and license.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Acquiring the base market_: Get access to the network of customers.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Acquiring IP_ _(intellectual property)_: Acquiring intangible intellectual assets such as patents, publications, trademarks, and copyrights, which will increase overall company valuation.

    &#x20;

From the preceding six reasons, an AI startup can focus on making itself an interesting acquisition target.

### Challenges of Building AI Startups

With the democratization of AI platforms, tools, and libraries, many startup founders think that building AI startups such as AIaaS, MLaaS, and AI-powered SaaS is similar to building traditional SaaS. But building an intelligent product that will improve overtime with more data is more challenging than building a non-intelligent SaaS.

My experience building AI products has challenges as follows:

1.  1\.

    AI is largely dealing with human perception. A good output is often very abstract and not easily defined. For example, automatic quality inspection problems will largely depend on the preference and experience of the human inspector, and the performance of the age detection system will largely depend on how the person visually looks at the image vs. the real age. Figure [2-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6) is an example of a photograph of an actress that could deceive individuals regarding her age. Due to this nature, customer onboarding will always involve a lot of handholding and education. Managing the expectation of the customer is the challenge of any AI startup.

    &#x20;

1.  2\.

    The quality of the data is everything. And it is not cheap. Data operations, an end-to-end data collection cycle, ETL (Extract, Transfer, and Load), annotation, and data quality evaluation are time-consuming and costly. The main premise is that we will never have full control over user-generated data, even with all the training sessions, disclaimers, and guidelines. So though maintaining data quality is a shared responsibility between AI companies and their customers, it is more of the AI company’s concern than the customer’s.

    &#x20;
2.  3\.

    Another challenge with AI is edge cases or long-tail problems, where the AI will inevitably encounter scenarios in which the systems do not perform as required or as expected. We have methods to deal with this situation called active learning. But this will always involve humans doing manual model evaluation and annotation or human in the loop (HITL).

    &#x20;
3.  4\.

    Due to data drift, where data that feeds the AI models tends to change over time, AI will always need continual training and redeployment. This can cost a thousand dollars or more for compute and storage infrastructure resources and tools (i.e., for model drift monitoring, XAI (explainable AI), etc.).

    &#x20;
4.  5\.

    The complexity of AI development requires a technical team with very strong scientific and software engineering capabilities. We need to hire a person with higher education in AI-related areas (i.e., a master or PhD in computer vision, machine learning, or natural language processing). This will have a consequence of high personnel costs for acquiring and retaining talents.

    &#x20;

### The Key to Building Successful AI Startups

My definition of a successful AI startup is a startup with a good margin profit, leading to a high valuation and finally being acquired with a fair number. From the previous section, we learned that to be a successful AI startup, the AI company must solve the challenges of cost and scalability. Therefore, there are seven things to do:

1.  1\.

    _Selecting a use case_: Start by choosing the right use case with a significant number of customers that would pay you, and you can solve their problem with the same model.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Solve one problem better than anyone_: Build an AI algorithm that solves that _one_ problem perfectly, along with all the edge cases. After you solve this problem, you can explore other problems with other AI models.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Add values without overhauling workflows_: The AI solutions must be easy to install and frictionless. Don’t try to replace existing customers’ systems, but look to layer the top.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Make the AI systems as_ _self-serve_ _as possible_: The customer must have the capability to change the rules, parameters, dashboard, and even data operations themselves.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Automate everything_: Internally automate the training and data pipeline as much as possible to increase operational efficiency and reduce manual work. Build internal tools that will automate things.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Easy and scalable deployment_: The AI must be easy to deploy and scale across platforms and environments such as local (on-premise) and cloud and different hardware (Android, Intel, etc.).

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _Reduce data acquisition and user input uncertainty_: Bad data acquisition is the Achilles heel of any AI system, especially machine learning. Therefore, we must have a mechanism to limit the variance and unpredictability of user inputs and condition them so that they will be suitable for our model inference. For example, an AI company building biometrics eKYC (electronic know-your-customer) and face spoof detection for smartphones must always create mobile SDKs to limit users’ bad and unacceptable inputs (see Figure [2-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)).

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="195" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-7 </p></figcaption></figure>

We cannot limit how the users take their facial images. We also cannot control the smartphone and the feature used (i.e., using filters). Therefore, we must create SDKs to be used to create a mobile app that will help us perform the necessary pre-processing tasks (i.e., image enhancement, image alignment) before feeding the image into the machine learning model. The SDK reduces the variety and uncertainties of the user inputs.

### The Successful AI Startup Patterns

The journey of an AI startup ideally starts when a subject matter expert (SME), someone with years of experience and network in a particular industry, meets an AI wizard with academic credentials who has years of experience developing AI systems in a similar industry. They have an itch to more intelligently solve a particular problem in their industry domain and scale that solution. Figure [2-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_2\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8) shows a proven framework from an idea to a successful exit for an AI startup.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_2_Chapter/522265_1_En_2_Fig8_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="681" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 2-8 </p></figcaption></figure>

1.  1\.

    _Ideation phase_: The SME meets the AI wizard. They develop some ideas that will disrupt how people work in a particular industry and domain.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Validating phase_: They validate the market by analyzing the industry deeply, measuring the business and technical feasibility, and finding early adopters to test their idea who would pay for their AI MVP (Minimal Viable Product).

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Consulting phase_: They build an AI consulting service together than working on numerous AI projects in a particular domain industry to prove that they can solve problems more efficiently with AI. They will also collect more data and deal with more edge cases from different clients.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Building a solution accelerator phase_: Building a solution accelerator is a useful strategy for AI startups as it can help accelerate the development process and reduce the time to market their products. By pre-building reusable components, frameworks, and modules, startups can focus on developing custom features and fine-tuning their algorithms to meet specific customer needs. This approach can reduce development time and costs and improve scalability and flexibility in deploying the solution to a wider customer base. Additionally, having a well-designed and documented solution accelerator can enhance the startup’s credibility and attract potential investors and customers who are looking for proven and scalable AI solutions.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Internal AI engine phase_: The AI solution framework is more refined as more data is collected and more edge cases are handled. The next step is to automate the whole process by building an AI engine to be used internally. The AI engine is comprised of several modules, such as the machine learning/decision optimization module, web/mobile interface, and data handling module.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _AI-first SaaS phase_: Time to target a bigger market. They can scale the AI solution by building a more generic and productized version for the larger customer base by building AI-first SaaS. AI-first SaaS is a full-stack application with AI as its core, which can be sold directly to the customers with no handholding process like consulting services.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _AIaaS (AI as a Service) phase_: The experience building an internal AI engine and AI-first SaaS is useful for building another type of AI startup, AI as a Service (AIaaS), by productizing and selling your AI engine to developers and other SaaS companies.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    _Building an IP (intellectual property) phase_: To maximize the value of a platform and its associated algorithms, it is recommended that they be transformed into intellectual property (IP), such as patents and publications. This transformation enhances the platform’s valuation and makes it more attractive to potential buyers. Through IP protection, a platform and its algorithms can be safeguarded from unauthorized use, and their value can be maintained over time. Furthermore, publishing research on the platform and its algorithms can increase their visibility and establish them as leaders in their respective fields, ultimately increasing their marketability. Thus, transforming a platform and its associated algorithms into IP is a prudent business strategy for any company seeking to increase its valuation and attract potential buyers.

    &#x20;
9.  9\.

    _Exit phase_: When the AI startup has a good user base, data, technology moats, and solid propositions, it is time for the founders to think about an exit strategy. The AI technology landscape is changing very fast; wrong timing for exit may cause disappointment. The typical path for an AI startup is M\&A, merging with a company, or selling the whole company and products to a bigger company that sees the strategic fit in the acquisition.

    &#x20;

The rule in the AI startup game is to enter quickly and exit fast, as the AI tech landscape changes rapidly. The AI technique working well today may not work well tomorrow. An AI startup must know when to exit at the right moment. AI is an enabling technology. Hence, it is natural that the acquisition by bigger tech companies is the most common exit strategy.

### Conclusion

This chapter explains how AI startups solve a substantial problem for their enterprise customers. They are building AI products to be consumed by enterprises. This can significantly save time and cost.

To provide value for their enterprise customers, AI startups must understand the core and supporting activities in the value chain of their target industries and show the tangible benefits of using AI to augment or automate the decision-making process. Therefore, an AI product manager must know about AI and statistics, as well as product management, software development, and business analysis.

Building an AI startup is different from building a traditional SaaS startup. Due to the relatively short-lived nature of AI as a commodity, the goal of any AI startup should be to have the optimal valuation and exit at the right time. AI startup founders must find the recipe for success by providing good business value for customers, building strong AI algorithms and data moats, and scaling up quickly. In the next chapter, we will learn how to validate an AI startup idea’s market and technology feasibility.
