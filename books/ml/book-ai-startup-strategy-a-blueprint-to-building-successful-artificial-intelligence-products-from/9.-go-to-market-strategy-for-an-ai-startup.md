# 9. Go-to-Market Strategy for an AI Startup

The previous chapters explored the essential steps in validating, developing, and operationalizing an AI product. This chapter will delve into the crucial topic of the go-to-market (GTM) strategy for an AI startup. Similar to any other product, launching an AI product requires a well-defined strategy to make it a successful and sustainable business. We will discuss the significance of the GTM strategy for businesses and the unique challenges that AI startups face while devising their GTM strategy.

We will delve into the importance of a go-to-market strategy for three types of AI products: AI (as a) Solution, AI as a Service, and AI (as a) Toolkit. Launching an AI product requires careful planning to avoid wasting time, risks, and costs associated with failed launches or internal misunderstandings.

Therefore, it’s crucial to understand the key components of a successful go-to-market strategy and how they differ for AI products. Additionally, we will provide a case study for each of the three types of AI products to help illustrate how to apply these principles in practice. By the end of this chapter, you will clearly understand the importance of a GTM strategy for an AI product and the key differences between the GTM strategies for AI products and general products.

### Background

Previous chapters have distinguished between AI-powered SaaS and AI-first SaaS, where the former adds intelligence to workflows and the latter is AI-centric and nonfunctional without AI. AIaaS targets developers and data scientists, while AI-first SaaS caters to end users. These distinctions are essential for discussions on AI startups. This chapter discusses the importance of a go-to-market strategy for AI startups. Despite AI’s hype and enthusiasm, launching an AI product requires careful planning to avoid costs, risks, and misunderstandings. We highlight the unique approach needed for AI startups and compare it with a general go-to-market strategy.

When bringing a new product to market, it’s important to have a clear go-to-market (GTM) strategy. Unlike a long-term marketing or product strategy, a GTM strategy is a short-term plan that spans 6–18 months and is guided by a longer-term product and marketing strategy. However, a well-executed GTM strategy can lead to increased market awareness and ensure that you don’t waste time and resources on a product that isn’t necessary. By launching your product into a new market, repositioning your brand, or increasing sales of existing products, a strong GTM strategy can bring countless benefits to your business.

For example, here’s the journey of Blue Yonder, a successful AI company that Panasonic acquired in 2021. The company was founded in 2008 by Professor Michael Feindt, a particle physicist passionate about applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world business problems. Blue Yonder’s unique proposition is using AI and machine learning to help businesses make smarter decisions and optimize their operations, such as forecasting demand, optimizing inventory, and pricing products. Panasonic acquired Blue Yonder for $7.1 billion to enhance their portfolio of solutions for the supply chain, manufacturing, and logistics industries.

Blue Yonder’s GTM (go-to-market) strategy provides end-to-end solutions that allow businesses to optimize their operations through AI-powered decision-making. The company targets specific industries, including retail, manufacturing, and logistics, and offers a range of products and services that cater to the unique needs of each industry. The crucial part of their GTM strategy is building long-term partnerships with clients like Microsoft and Accenture and investing in research and development to create new solutions that cater to evolving market trends and customer requirements. This helps them develop personalized solutions that match each client’s unique needs.

Another important aspect of Blue Yonder’s GTM strategy is its focus on digital transformation. The company recognizes that many traditional industries are struggling to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and aims to help these industries transition to a more data-driven, AI-powered future.

This focus on digital transformation aligns with Panasonic’s broader strategic goals of becoming a leader in the digitalization of manufacturing, logistics, and retail industries. From Panasonic’s perspective, the acquisition of Blue Yonder represents an opportunity to accelerate their digital transformation efforts by leveraging Blue Yonder’s expertise and technology.

By integrating Blue Yonder’s AI-powered solutions into their existing portfolio of products and services, Panasonic can offer more comprehensive solutions that help clients optimize their operations and improve their bottom line.

Now, if we are to see the other side, several examples of AI startups have failed to enter the market. Ansaro, a SaaS that aimed to revolutionize the recruiting industry through innovative AI technologies,[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1) is one example. The company was established in 2016 and received $2.25M from institutional investors and $750K from friends and family but ultimately failed to gain market traction (Figure [9-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).

Ansaro encountered several challenges with their go-to-market strategy. Firstly, they were slow to pivot and failed to question their initial product plan, wasting time and resources. Secondly, they focused on the wrong pain point, pitching new hire quality improvement to CHROs instead of hiring efficiency to recruiters. Lastly, they tackled a problem that required a long time to measure results, making it difficult to demonstrate ROI to HR buyers. The moral is that even with innovation and funding, AI startups can face difficulties in a highly competitive market.

A GTM strategy is essentially the “game plan” that describes how each functional team will contribute to launching a new product feature or service to the target customer to gain a competitive advantage. It specifies how the company will communicate and deliver the feature’s value to potential customers, buyers, and other market influencers. A go-to-market strategy aims to provide a powerful, winning total customer experience to attract, win, and retain the most desirable customers while generating high sales and market share growth at the lowest possible cost.

A strong go-to-market strategy always includes multiple driving factors. These factors include value proposition, positioning, distribution model, customers, distribution channels, and price. However, we must remember that AI startups may have multiple target markets. There could be B2C, B2B, and even B2G target markets. The difference in the target market plays a big role in deciding which approach to use, what message we want to deliver, what pricing strategy we want to apply, and what the distribution channel looks like.

Talking about AI solutions, AI as a Service, and AI as a Toolkit, this chapter will discuss the needs of a specific target market, how to generate a value proposition and message that resonates with the target market, the pricing model, and how to create a customer journey map. At some point, we will also emphasize how to develop an API and SDK that are user-friendly and flexible and how to create an impeccable marketing strategy. Similar to the previous chapters, this chapter includes several case studies. The three business models are believed to facilitate a comprehensive discussion of the GTM strategy for AI startups.

This chapter aims to provide founders, product managers, business managers, and executives of AI startups with a comprehensive understanding of the essential elements of an effective go-to-market strategy. Through case studies and step-by-step guides throughout the chapter, you will learn how to develop and execute a GTM strategy that positions your AI products in the market, attracts customers, and drives revenue growth. In particular, the following subjects are going to be discussed in this chapter:

1.  1\.

    Defining your target audience and customer personas

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    Identifying your unique value proposition and messaging

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Understanding the needs and pain points of developers

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Creating a scalable sales and marketing infrastructure

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Leveraging digital marketing channels and social media

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    Building strategic partnerships and alliances

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    Measuring and optimizing your GTM strategy for continuous improvement

    &#x20;

This chapter provides a clear roadmap for creating a successful GTM strategy in the competitive AI marketplace. You will learn key takeaways and steps for bringing AI products to market and achieving business objectives. It covers building a unique value proposition and creating an effective marketing strategy and includes case studies of successful implementations by Nodeflux and Visionaire.

### Introduction to the Go-to-Market Strategy for AI Startups

Product, channel, message or value proposition, and market are the four primary elements of a GTM strategy (Figure [9-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)). We can all agree that to have an effective and relevant message, we must fully comprehend what customers find appealing about our products. In developing a GTM strategy for a product, we must ensure that we only sell products that the customer indeed requires so that we can be certain that someone is willing to purchase them.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_9_Chapter/522265_1_En_9_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="729" width="1063"><figcaption><p>Figure 9-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

Therefore, if we want to sell products in large quantities, we must be prepared and map out the needs and expectations of our potential customers, which we can only obtain by working closely with them and listening attentively to what they say.

To effectively communicate with customers, businesses must identify and develop channels that serve as distribution points for their products and services. This requires a solid understanding of the target audience’s preferred channels and potential channels that could be used in the future.

Focusing efforts solely on customer channels is important, considering factors such as geography, demography, and psychology. For instance, it would be futile for startups to sell AI products in regions with inadequate infrastructure or limited Internet connection and budget. By identifying the right channels and markets, businesses can focus their efforts and increase their chances of success. Briefly, the extent to which we comprehend customer needs, expectations, and behavior is crucial to the success of any GTM strategy. We must conduct a thorough investigation into what the customer desires. This is the fundamental basis for every successful GTM strategy.

In this section, we will examine the necessity of having a go-to-market strategy for an AI startup and dig deeper into the descriptions of each type of AI product discussed in the previous section. It is hoped that once we understand what makes a good go-to-market strategy, we will be able to anticipate the topics that will be further emphasized in the book.

#### The Importance of a Go-to-Market Strategy for AI Startups

Launching a product without a well-developed strategy is a mistake that should be avoided. After a new product is introduced to the market, there may be a temptation to consider the job done. However, when companies lack a clear and unified strategy for their AI product, it can lead to various issues. These issues may include miscommunication between internal teams, an underdeveloped pricing model, difficulties for the marketing team to create an effective message, and potential customers unaware of the product’s existence. Therefore, it is crucial to have a solid strategy in place before launching a new product to ensure its success.

All of the factors mentioned earlier may result in tension between the team and key stakeholders, hindering the business’s ability to collaborate. Therefore, having a strategy in place can foster the business’s growth potential when launching a new product. A GTM (go-to-market) strategy is essential for any startup and becomes even more critical for AI startups. Here are some reasons having a GTM strategy is important for AI startups:

* _Helps identify the target audience_: AI startups will always target a specific demographic. A GTM strategy assists in identifying the target audience and their particular needs. It allows startups to comprehend their customers better and tailor their marketing efforts to meet their needs.
* _Guides product development_: A GTM strategy aids startups in comprehending the market they are entering, their competitors, and their unique value proposition. This knowledge guides product development and ensures the startup is constructing a product that meets the target market’s needs.
* _Optimizes marketing efforts_: A GTM strategy outlines the marketing channels and tactics that are most effective for reaching the target audience. This helps startups optimize their marketing efforts and use their resources efficiently.
* _Attracts investors_: Before investing, investors want to see a clear path to market for a startup. A well-developed GTM strategy can increase a startup’s appeal to investors and its likelihood of receiving funding.
* _Increases revenue_: A well-executed GTM strategy can assist startups in reaching their intended audience and generating revenue more quickly. Additionally, it can help them build a solid brand and reputation, resulting in long-term success.

In conclusion, it is almost impossible for AI startups to be successful without a GTM strategy. It aids in determining whom to market to, directs product growth, enhances promotional efforts, brings in capital, and boosts sales. AI startups may have trouble breaking into the market and reaching their objectives without a well-defined GTM strategy.

#### Description of Different Types of AI Products

The business model or type of AI product will ultimately determine how we will sell the product to the market. This is because a different model will significantly shape how the product will be sold to the market.

To better understand the challenges faced by several AI business models and their target market, we will get to the description of each one, understand their consequences, and get through some case studies relevant to the business model and the target market.

**AI (as a) Solution**

Many people agree that machine learning is one of the fastest-growing software areas, making it popular as part of SaaS or a product. As machine learning becomes more advanced, it can automate or augment cognitive tasks in enterprises across industries. Using machine learning helps enable any software to learn from every task or transaction, improving intelligence and efficiency along the way. Furthermore, as an AI-first application solution, this business model can dig deeper into insights and data, which will help you with the competition.

In this section, we will talk about AI solutions. In the previous chapters, we learned that two AI business models target end users: AI-powered SaaS and AI-first SaaS. AI-first solutions are products or services designed with AI as the primary focus to enhance user experience through AI capabilities. AI-powered solutions, on the other hand, refer to products or services that use AI to improve certain aspects, but AI is not necessarily the main focus. The main difference is that AI-first solutions prioritize AI, while AI-powered solutions use AI to enhance existing products or services.

We refer to these two business models as AI (as a) Solution. This AI business model is selling AI-first application solutions where AI is empowering the application, such as AI-powered CRM and AI-powered logistics software. AI solutions’ target market is B2B, such as corporates, or B2C, such as end users.

The target market has a substantial impact on their purpose and orientation. AI solution business models focus on streamlining business processes, generating revenue, or reducing expenses by leveraging AI.

We will explore this business model by understanding Optitrax (Optitrax.co) as an example.

Optitrax is a cutting-edge software solution that empowers users to create and optimize delivery routes while considering a wide range of individual parameters, such as vehicle preferences, capacity, delivery times, customer service windows, historical traffic data, and work order specifications. Optitrax caters to a diverse range of use cases and industries that are focused on exceptional delivery services.

Optitrax offers an AI-powered solution for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) delivery to streamline operations and optimize deliveries. This solution addresses common challenges in FMCG delivery, such as inefficient driver tracking, suboptimal delivery times, and high delivery costs. By using individual parameters such as vehicle preferences, capacity, delivery time or customer service windows, historical traffic data, and work order specifications, Optitrax can provide an optimized delivery route for FMCG businesses. With this innovative software, FMCG companies can save time and money while ensuring efficient and timely delivery to their customers.

**AI as a Service**

AI-based software depends on hardware, such as GPU-based processing, which can be expensive to buy and maintain.

Instead of in-house development, individuals and companies can use Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS), a third-party artificial intelligence (AI) outsourcing service. They can experiment with AI to attain different goals with minimal initial cost and risk. Experimentation can assist the user in testing various machine learning algorithms based on natural language processing, computer vision, or generative adversarial network (generative AI). This AI business model sells their product through API calls, which can be integrated into users’ applications, with developers as their target users.

AI as a Service targets software houses or system integrators (SIs) and individual developers. Aside from delivering AI through API, providing it through SDK could become an added value.

The main challenge is to build a developer-friendly API/SDK.

Identifai is a great example of an AI as a Service model. Identifai is an eKYC solution software developed by Nodeflux. This product focuses on identifying and verifying individuals through face recognition. Aside from face recognition, Identifai has developed several machine learning models, such as face liveness detection and ID OCR. They are mixing their marketing method between account-based marketing for the middle and bottom funnels and pull marketing for the upper funnel.

**AI (as a) Toolkit**

AI (as a) Toolkit or AI toolkits are pre-built tools and frameworks that enable developers to build, train, and deploy AI models without substantial AI or machine learning knowledge. AI toolkits are frequently deployed as a command-line interface (CLI), which can support the developers. The toolkits could include several things, such as data annotation and augmentation tools, machine learning and deep learning experimentation tools, and machine learning workflow and orchestration tools. The toolkit results can be deployed to operating systems, containers, or virtual machines (VMs).

In AI toolkits, the developers are focused more on the development using the AI tool and the integration with the existing workflows and technology stacks. The developer journey map for AI toolkits is a set of steps developers go through when working with these tools. It is designed to help developers understand how to build and integrate AI models into their applications.

The developer journey typically starts with installing and setting up the toolkit and then building, training, and validating the models using the provided APIs and SDKs. Once the models are built, developers will integrate them into their existing workflows and technology stacks. The journey also includes ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the models and updating them as necessary.

Unlike AI as a Service and AI as an Engine, where models are pre-built and offered by the provider, developers can construct and train their models using AI toolkits. This enables companies to tailor the models to their use case while incorporating domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the integration process with existing workflows and technology stacks is intended to be as seamless as possible, allowing developers to simply add AI capabilities to their existing applications.

An example of this AI business model is Visionaire. This computer vision integration platform enables the integration of any deep learning vision model to any camera to be deployed to a low-processing, low-bandwidth device.

### Go-to-Market Strategy for AI (as a) Solution

This AI business model refers to an application or platform that uses AI to solve a specific business problem, is designed for a particular industry, and is sold as a software solution. This model targets end business users as the primary market. For a successful go-to-market strategy, identifying the target market is crucial. By doing so, the development team can create solutions that meet the target audience’s specific needs, reducing development time and cost. Customized solutions can differentiate companies from their competitors and offer more appealing solutions to potential customers. Tailoring AI (as a) Solution to a specific target market can also lead to a higher ROI as the solution is more likely to be adopted and used by the target market, resulting in increased revenue and profitability.

#### Identifying the Target Market

Developing AI (as a) Solution without understanding the target audience can lead to an irrelevant or ineffective product that doesn’t solve the intended problem. By understanding the target audience’s needs, developers can ensure that the AI solution addresses the target market’s specific challenges and pain points and meets the expectations of potential customers. In previous chapters, we have defined in detail how to validate the target market, but in the GTM context, we repeat the process as follows:

1.  1\.

    _Define the problem_: The first step is defining the problem the AI solution intends to solve. This will help identify the potential markets for the solution.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Conduct market research_: Conducting market research helps identify the target market by collecting and analyzing data on customer behavior, preferences, demographics, and other relevant factors.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Analyze competition_: Analyzing the competition helps understand the existing solutions available in the market and how they meet the target audience’s needs.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Segment the market_: Segmentation involves dividing the target market into smaller groups based on shared characteristics, such as age, gender, income, or interests. This helps identify each segment’s specific needs and preferences and tailor the solution to meet their needs.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Develop buyer personas_: Buyer personas are fictional representations of the ideal customers based on market research and segmentation analysis. They help understand the target audience’s needs, pain points, motivations, and preferences.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Validate the target market_: Validating the target market involves testing the solution with a sample group of the target audience to ensure that it meets their needs and preferences.

    &#x20;

Understanding the target audience is critical to the success of AI solutions. By identifying the target market and understanding their needs, developers can tailor the solution to meet the specific requirements and preferences of the target audience. Additionally, understanding the target audience can help developers anticipate future needs and trends, enabling them to create more innovative and relevant solutions.

However, B2B (business-to-business) end users have unique needs and requirements that differ from those of B2C (business-to-consumer) end users. Here are some of the key needs of B2B end users:

* _Efficiency_: B2B end users are typically focused on efficiency and productivity. They need AI (as a) Solution to help them automate tasks, streamline processes, and reduce operational costs.
* _Scalability_: B2B end users need AI (as a) Solution that scales with their business needs. This means that the solution should be able to handle large volumes of data and users as the business grows.
* _Customization_: B2B end users often have specific requirements and workflows that off-the-shelf AI solutions may not address. They need solutions customized to their specific needs and integrated with their existing systems.
* _Security_: B2B end users are concerned about data security and privacy. They need AI solutions that provide robust security features like encryption, access control, and data backup.
* _ROI_: B2B end users are focused on AI (as a) Solution’s ROI (return on investment). They need solutions delivering measurable benefits, such as increased revenue, reduced costs, or improved customer satisfaction.

Understanding the needs of B2B end users is essential for developing effective AI solutions for businesses. By addressing these needs, developers can create solutions to help businesses achieve their goals, increase efficiency, and stay competitive in their industries.

#### Developing a Unique Value Proposition

To develop a successful AI (as a) Solution business model, it is important first to identify the target market and understand the competition. Understanding the competitive landscape can help identify gaps and opportunities in the market. After this step, the next is to define the unique value proposition (UVP) for the AI solution.

This clear and compelling statement describes the specific benefits and values the solution provides to the target market.

The UVP should differentiate the solution from competitors and focus on the benefits and outcomes that customers care about.

Once the UVP is defined, crafting clear, concise messaging that resonates with the target market is essential. The messaging should focus on the benefits and outcomes that customers care about, use language that the target market understands, and resonate with their emotions and motivations. A unique value proposition and messaging that resonates with the target market is crucial to building a successful AI solution business model (Figure [9-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_9_Chapter/522265_1_En_9_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="275" width="1423"><figcaption><p>Figure 9-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

Finally, testing your messaging with your target market and iterating based on their feedback is important. You can use surveys, focus groups, or other methods to gather feedback on your messaging and adjust as needed. By following these steps, you can develop a unique value proposition and messaging that resonate with your target market for your AI solution business model. Remember to focus on the benefits and outcomes your customers care about and continuously test and iterate to ensure your messaging is effective.

#### Designing a Customer Journey Map

B2B-oriented AI startups should consider creating a customer journey map, which outlines the customer journey across the touchpoints used for a given stage or set of stages. This explains the touchpoints or steps a customer takes to complete a specific task and the digital channels and content utilized.

Here are some steps you can follow to create a customer journey map for an AI solution business model:

1.  1\.

    _Identify the stages of the customer journey_: The first step is identifying the various stages of the customer journey. This may include awareness, consideration, purchase, and post-purchase. For an AI solution business model, additional stages may include onboarding, training, and ongoing support.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Define customer personas_: Understanding your customer’s needs and expectations is key to creating a customer journey map. Define customer personas that represent your ideal customers, based on demographics, behavior, goals, and pain points.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Map out customer touchpoints_: Next, identify the various touchpoints that a customer may have with your business during each stage of the journey. These touchpoints may include website visits, social media interactions, customer service calls, and product demos.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Gather customer feedback_: To better understand the customer experience, gather feedback from your customers. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or online reviews. Use this feedback to identify pain points and areas where you can improve the customer experience.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Identify opportunities for AI solutions_: Once you have identified the touchpoints and pain points in the customer journey, look for opportunities to integrate AI solutions. For example, AI chatbots can be used to provide instant customer support, while AI-powered personalization can create a more personalized experience for the customer.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Create a visual representation_: Finally, create a visual representation of the customer journey map using tools like flowcharts or diagrams. This will help you visualize the customer journey and identify areas where you can improve the customer experience.

    &#x20;

In summary, designing a customer journey map for an AI solution business model involves identifying the various touchpoints and interactions that a customer has with your business, defining customer personas, gathering customer feedback, and identifying opportunities to integrate AI solutions. A visual representation of the customer journey map can help identify improvement areas and create a more personalized customer experience.

#### Developing a Marketing Strategy to Reach the Target Market

Developing a marketing strategy for an AI (as a) Solution business model involves understanding your target market, creating a unique value proposition, identifying the best channels to reach your audience, and measuring the effectiveness of your efforts.

Although reaching the customer directly as a marketing method could help AI solutions reach many audiences, sales representatives will be needed eventually. As we approach the middle of the funnel, the customer will require detailed information about the products, which can only be provided effectively by a sales development representative (SDR) or salesperson.

In targeting B2B customers, especially for a complex product based on AI, a high-touch marketing approach is typically the most effective strategy. This approach involves deploying a field sales force to personally engage with potential customers and help them understand the product. A high-touch marketing approach is particularly suitable for AI solutions because AI can be complex and challenging to sell. Direct assistance through a high-touch approach can help customers better understand the value and benefits of the product, leading to increased adoption and sales.

Here are some steps to help you develop an effective marketing strategy:

1.  1\.

    _Identify your target audience_: Consider who will benefit most from your AI solution. This could include businesses in a particular industry or individuals with a specific problem that your AI solution can solve. Once you’ve identified your target audience, research their demographics, interests, and pain points to understand how to market to them effectively.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Analyze your competition_: Research your competitors in the market and analyze their marketing strategies. Pay attention to their messaging, target audience, and the channels they use to promote their solutions. Determine what differentiates your AI solution from theirs, and use that information to create a unique marketing strategy. You can use web applications such as Rank Signals and SpyFu to analyze your competitor’s marketing strategy.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Identify your unique selling proposition (USP)_: Your USP is what sets your AI solution apart from your competitors. It’s important to clearly define your USP so you can communicate it effectively to potential customers. Some possible USPs for an AI solution product might include faster processing times, more accurate predictions, or better data security.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Set marketing goals and KPIs_: Identify specific marketing goals and KPIs that align with your overall GTM strategy. For example, you might aim to generate a certain number of leads, achieve a certain conversion rate, or increase brand awareness within a particular industry.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Develop a content marketing plan_: Create a content marketing plan that targets your identified audience with relevant and informative content. This could include blog posts, infographics, case studies, or webinars. Ensure your content aligns with your USP and addresses the pain points of your target audience.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Build a social media presence_: Determine which social media platforms your target audience uses most frequently, and create a presence on those platforms. Share your content on social media, engage with your audience, and use paid advertising to reach a wider audience.

    &#x20;
7.  7\.

    _Utilize email marketing_: Create a marketing campaign targeting your identified audience with personalized and relevant messaging. This can include newsletters, product updates, and promotional offers. Use your email campaign to nurture leads and keep them engaged with your solution.

    &#x20;
8.  8\.

    _Consider paid advertising_: Use paid advertising such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or LinkedIn Ads to reach a wider audience and generate leads. Ensure your ads are targeted to your specific audience and use clear messaging highlighting your USP.

    &#x20;
9.  9\.

    _Measure and optimize_: Track your marketing KPIs and adjust your strategy accordingly. Use data to optimize your marketing campaign and improve your ROI. Continually test and refine your messaging, content, and channels to maximize your marketing effectiveness.

    &#x20;

You can create a marketing strategy for your AI solution business model if you follow these steps. That strategy will effectively reach the target market for your AI solution. Remember that you should continuously adjust your strategy in light of the results to guarantee that you are achieving your professional objectives.

### Go-to-Market Strategy for AI (as a) Toolkit

AI toolkits are collections of software tools and frameworks that help developers and data scientists build and deploy AI applications. A GTM (go-to-market) strategy is important for AI toolkits because it enables companies to effectively bring their AI toolkits to market by identifying the target audience, understanding their pain points, and communicating the unique value proposition of their toolkit.

#### Understanding the Needs and Pain Points of Developers and Data Scientists

As mentioned in the previous chapters, AI toolkits allow developers to create, train, and deploy AI models using various platforms and libraries for machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, pre-trained models, data visualization, deployment, and development frameworks. These toolkits make it easy for developers with limited experience in AI or machine learning to build data acquisition, augmentation, and annotation pipelines, experiment with different models, and deploy them on various platforms. The main advantage of these products is that they enable users to create their own AI models based on their business needs without starting from scratch. Examples of AI toolkits are Landing AI, Viso AI, Clarifai, and Masterful AI, as well as data tools such as Snorkel and Scale AI.

AI (as a) Toolkit is a platform where users can experiment to develop customized AI solutions based on their business needs. This differs from AI as a Service products, which are more packaged and targeted toward a specific use case. Developers and data scientists are the primary target audience for AI toolkits. So it is important to understand what factors these segments consider when selecting an AI toolkit product:

1.  a.

    _Time constraints_: AI toolkits can help developers build and deploy AI models faster with pre-built models, tools, and templates.

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    _Technical complexity_: AI toolkits can provide libraries and frameworks that abstract away complex algorithms and mathematical concepts, allowing developers without a background in data science to build AI models more quickly.

    &#x20;

    &#x20;

To create products with specific applications, we begin by analyzing the industrial sector. For instance, when developing a product that utilizes computer vision, we identify the markets and industries that can benefit from this technology and the business processes that can be improved. With this knowledge, we can develop targeted marketing strategies and tailor our product development to meet the needs of our target audience. By understanding our target audience’s goals, challenges, and pain points, we can create products and services that are more appealing to them.

#### Developing a User-Friendly and Comprehensive AI Toolkit

To ensure significant AI toolkit product adoption, the user-friendliness of AI products is an important consideration, followed by flexibility. Creating a single tool that caters to only one specific use case or industry requirement would waste money spent on research and development. In previous chapters, we covered the topic of AI product design. One of the main points that we went over was how creating an AI model as a toolkit ultimately needs to have the flexibility to be applied to various industries while also being closely related to a few specific use cases. If we develop an AI model for face recognition, for example, we need to think about the user and the use cases. The model can be used by law enforcement agencies, property owners who need round-the-clock monitoring, and city governments for urban supervision. These are only a few of the many possibilities that may arise from a single model. To make AI toolkits more user-friendly, it’s important to consider factors beyond just developing multiple models:

1.  1\.

    _Emphasize usability_: Software developers and data scientists can find AI toolkits difficult to use. To solve this problem, make sure that your toolkit is user-friendly. This can be achieved by creating a simple and easy-to-use interface, providing detailed documentation and guides, and simplifying the installation and setup process as much as possible.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Pre-built templates_: To help users overcome the learning curve when using your AI toolkit, you can provide pre-built models and pipelines as templates. This will enable users to get started more quickly and easily. Offering a variety of templates that cover different industries and use cases will be beneficial.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Make available various development frameworks and library resources_: Provide development frameworks and libraries for common programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript so that it is simple for developers to incorporate your AI toolkit into their existing workflows. This will make it easier for developers to use your AI toolkit.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Offer data visualization tools_: The results that data scientists obtain from their AI models can be easily interpreted and visualized with the assistance of data visualization tools.

By adhering to these steps, you can create an AI toolkit that is comprehensive and user-friendly. This toolkit will cater to the requirements and concerns of data scientists and software developers. This can help differentiate your product in the market and provide a valuable solution for those looking to construct and deploy AI models quickly and easily.

#### Determining the Pricing Model and Packaging That Appeals to Developers

When packaging an AI toolkit, it’s important to consider the target audience’s needs and the type of toolkit being developed. For instance, a deep learning toolkit may require more computational resources, which can be better suited for containerization or a virtual machine. Alternatively, a toolkit designed for beginner developers may benefit from a GUI or IDE packaging, while a more advanced toolkit may be better suited to a CLI or containerization approach. Once the packaging model is chosen, the next step is to determine the pricing model. Generally, there are three standard pricing models for AI toolkit products:

1.  1\.

    _Utilization-based pricing_: This pricing model can be attractive for data scientists and developers who may not require extensive use of the AI toolkit but may experience usage spikes. They can save money over time by paying only for what they consume.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Price based on subscription_: This pricing model frequently appeals to developers and data scientists who employ the AI toolkit often. It also ensures they can always access the most recent updates and features.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Different tiers_: Providing tiers can be an effective way to appeal to a greater variety of customers. For instance, offering a free tier with basic functionality can attract new users. More advanced features in higher-priced tiers can appeal to those requiring more robust functionality.

    &#x20;

Some AI toolkit brands, such as Hugging Face, provide a free and open source version of their platform but charge for enterprise-level features and support. Others, including DataRobot, offer tiered pricing based on the number of users and the required level of support. Pricing and packaging of an AI toolkit should ultimately be determined by the needs of the target audience and the product’s unique value proposition. The pricing strategy you choose for your AI toolkit should consider the value you provide to your target audience, the cost of developing and maintaining your product, and your competition. Here are some pricing strategies that could work well for different packaging options:

1.  1\.

    _Command-line interface (CLI)_: Considering that CLI is a common packaging option for AI toolkits, you may want to consider a competitive price for your product. Users could pay a monthly or annual fee to access your toolkit under a subscription-based model. Alternatively, you could offer a tiered pricing structure based on the number of users, the level of support provided, or the toolkit’s features.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Graphical user interface (GUI)_: A GUI could make working with the command line easier for developers and data scientists unfamiliar with it. This could make your product more appealing to novices, which may be willing to pay more for an intuitive interface. You could use a model in which users pay a one-time fee to gain access to your GUI toolkit.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Integrated Development Environment (IDE)_: An IDE could be bundled with the AI toolkit to provide developers with a comprehensive development environment for working with the toolkit and creating AI models. Users could pay a monthly or annual fee to access your IDE toolkit, similar to CLI’s subscription-based model.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Containerization_: Containerization is an effective way to package and deploy AI models. It allows developers to use the same environment to run AI models on different machines and operating systems. Pricing can be based on the number of containers used, or a flat rate can be offered for a specific number of containers. Subscription-based pricing can also be an option.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Virtual machine_: Similar to containerization, packaging an AI toolkit in a virtual machine can provide developers with a consistent environment to build, train, and deploy AI models. Users could pay a monthly or annual fee to access your VM toolkit under a subscription-based model.

    &#x20;

How well AI toolkits do on the market depends significantly on how much they cost and how they are packaged. AI toolkits are complicated and high-tech products that need to be priced and packaged carefully to ensure they meet the intended audience’s needs. Pricing and packaging strategy includes several factors that affect how the toolkit is seen, how it competes with other similar products, and how well it can make money.

One important thing to consider is whom the product is meant for, which can change depending on the industry, company size, and use case. Enterprise-level companies may have very different needs than small businesses. For example, a large organization may need scalability, reliability, and the ability to work with other systems. On the other hand, small businesses may want something that is easy to use and cheap and has a shorter learning curve. So a well-thought-out pricing and packaging strategy should consider how different audiences have different needs and tastes.

When making a good pricing strategy, it’s also important to look into how competitors set their prices. By understanding industry standards and customer expectations, companies can find places where their AI toolkit may offer unique value that can be sold. Lastly, it’s important to test and change the pricing model to ensure it fits what customers want and the market needs. Getting customer feedback and tracking how they use your product can show you where prices or packaging may need to be changed.

#### Designing a Customer Journey Map

AI (as a) Toolkit and AI as a Service differ in control and customization, development and maintenance effort, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and time to market resulting in different customer journeys. For AI toolkit products, the customer journey starts with research and evaluation, followed by installation, configuration, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In contrast, AI service products focus more on evaluation, integration, and scaling, with less emphasis on the development effort.

The customer journey for an AI toolkit product begins with research and evaluation of the various AI toolkits available. Customers may have specific needs they wish to fulfill, so they would seek out toolkits corresponding to those needs. After selecting a toolkit, customers must install and configure it. Next, customers must design, develop, and test their AI models or applications, which can require significant time and resources. Lastly, the client must deploy and maintain the AI solution in their environment, which may require ongoing effort and expense. We can use the following framework to design a customer journey so that we can provide appropriate collateral and services at each stage that the user goes through:

* _Awareness_: Like every product, the user’s journey starts with finding the service that fits their needs. Therefore, our task in this phase is to utilize various touchpoints to build awareness of our brand and services. This activity can be in the form of social media posts that highlight the advantages of the services we have by previously defined pain points, blogging articles optimized through SEO, paid channels such as GDN or SEA for targeted users, making videos or webinars that focus on product introduction or services, and industry reports regarding the latest trends and use cases for the services we have.
* _Investigation and evaluation_: Once a potential user has discovered our AI toolkit product, they may compare it with similar products from different brands. As a product owner, it’s important to provide content showcasing our product’s unique benefits and features to ensure it’s the best choice for solving their problems. For example, we can create product comparison tables that make it easy for users to see how our toolkits compare with others on the market. We can also create whitepapers or case studies demonstrating how our AI model can be used in various industries and share endorsements or reviews from satisfied customers to build trust and credibility. All of this content motivates users to understand the value of our solutions and choose our product.
* _Selection_: After a user expresses interest in our AI toolkit, they move on to evaluate the product’s technical details, such as algorithms, precision, hardware, and software compatibility. This phase is called a POC or proof of concept, where the user will test and evaluate the AI model’s accuracy and performance. It is essential to provide expert support or advice to the user, especially if they encounter problems during the process, to ensure that their technical needs and customization options are met. Good communication between the user and support team is essential, as many AI startups fail during this stage due to their products failing to meet customer expectations.
* _Installation and arrangement_: The installation begins after the user has tried the model. The POC is going well during this stage, and the consumer has decided to use our product. It is critical that we provide a detailed user manual guide that describes how to install or configure our model in various software and hardware. At this time, a how-to video instructional could be one of the supporting resources. Don’t forget that the help forum or chatbot must be prepared to answer any issues the user may encounter during the procedure.
* _Design and development_: After installation and configuration, the user creates and tests the AI models or applications. This phase can take a long time, depending on the project’s complexity and the customer’s available resources. Although the customer has already committed to the product, they may still analyze its efficiency and precision. To help with this, providing documentation and download links that give users guidance and access to the AI tools and allow for customization is essential. We should also offer example codes or templates to make it easier for users to create AI-based applications or integrate the AI models into their products.
* _Deployment_: After developing and evaluating the AI models or apps, clients can deploy them within their environment. In this phase, we must provide multiple documents, such as instructions and checklists, to help the client install our AI model into their environment. It’s important to provide support resources if any issues arise during this process.
* _Maintenance_: After the AI system has been deployed, the customer is responsible for its maintenance to ensure continued accuracy and performance. This requires ongoing effort and resources, such as software updates, hardware upgrades, and troubleshooting. As the selection process has passed and the customer has committed to the product, ongoing technical support and maintenance services are necessary. We can provide documentation or a knowledge base with articles offering troubleshooting help or detailing new features and updates. It’s also important to communicate any changes to algorithms, precision, or customization to existing clients through email updates.

Let’s take an example of a provider offering AI as a Toolkit, specifically for face recognition, gesture analysis, and demographic recognition for surveillance cases. Suppose a business wants to upgrade the security of their facilities by adding these analytics to their security system. To do so, they start by researching and evaluating various AI toolkits in the market. During this phase, they consider factors like the toolkit’s precision, functionality, compatibility, and cost-effectiveness.

Once they find the right toolkit, they move to the installation and configuration phase, installing the software and configuring it to work with their security system. The toolkit provider may offer technical help or training to assist customers during this phase.

Next, they move to the design, development, and testing phase, using the AI toolkit to create their face recognition model, with gesture recognition and demographic recognition. This phase requires a significant investment of time and resources to ensure that the model identifies persons accurately and functions reliably.

After creating the model and the analytics pipeline, they move to the deployment phase, installing the AI model’s system in their environment, which may require ongoing maintenance and updates.

Overall, the customer experience for an AI toolkit product goes through various phases, including research, evaluation, installation, configuration, design, development, deployment, and maintenance, each with different time and resource requirements. The duration of each phase may vary depending on the project’s complexity and the client’s available resources.

#### Building a Partnership Strategy

A channel is how a business communicates with its customers and shares information. Unlike traditional media like TV or newspapers, channels facilitate two-way communication between businesses and customers, making them more effective for sales. Channels can be direct, indirect, or direct-to-customer sales channels. With the increasing demand for AI-based products and services, businesses must establish effective distribution channels to reach their target audience and offer excellent customer support. For AI toolkits, it’s especially important to have distributors and system integrators on board to ensure successful product integration. Before exploring partnerships with distributors and system integrators, let’s first understand the three common channel classifications used in many industries:

1.  1\.

    _Direct channel_: This is the traditional way where a company directly sells its products or services to customers through a sales force. It is best used for big ticket sales that require complex processes.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Indirect channel_: Intermediaries such as agents, resellers, and distributors provide value-added services such as installation, support, and configuration to increase the reach and consolidate services into unified products.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Direct-to-customer channel_: Businesses can directly sell their products or services to customers without intermediaries through methods such as direct mail, telephone, or the Internet. This can reduce costs and reach a wider audience, but there may be limitations such as the absence of customer support and customization options.

    &#x20;

The nature of your product plays a significant role in determining the most suitable sales channel for it. For instance, AI as a Toolkit is too complex to be directly sold to customers, while SaaS products like Workplace and ClickUp are simple enough to be marketed online. Since the effective adoption of AI solutions requires personalized assistance and technical support, low-cost channels like direct sales are not the best fit for promoting this kind of products.

When deciding which sales channel to use for your product, it’s important to consider four key factors:

* The first is the complexity and customizability of the product, as more complex and customizable products often require more involved distribution methods.
* The second factor to consider is the clarity of the product’s advantages, as this can impact the effectiveness of different sales channels.
* The third factor is the level of risk and uncertainty involved in the product, as more risky or uncertain products may require more specialized distribution channels.
*   Finally, the level of difficulty of the negotiations involved in selling the product should also be taken into account.

    By taking these factors into consideration, you can select a distribution method that is compatible with your product and maximizes your sales.

In this section, we will discuss two types of sales channels that play a critical role in the success of AI products as toolkits during the go-to-market (GTM) stage: distributors and system integrators. However, before diving deeper, let’s first understand the differences between these two types of channels. A distributor is an intermediary who purchases items from principals and resells them to end users or other channel partners. In contrast, a system integrator is an intermediary who combines hardware, software, and other components to produce a full solution for end users. The following are some important distinctions between distributors and system integrators:

1.  1\.

    _Product offering_: Typically, distributors offer a wide selection of items from numerous principals, whereas system integrators design bespoke solutions employing specific products and technology.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Sales process_: Distributors normally sell products, whereas system integrators sell full solutions that match the specific demands of their customers. They frequently collaborate with customers to understand their needs and build and deploy solutions to satisfy those demands.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Value-added services_: While distributors may provide technical support, training, and warranty services, system integrators often provide a broader range of services, such as design, installation, configuration, and continuing support.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Customer relationships_: While distributors have a vast customer base, they may not have as deep a relationship with their customers as system integrators, who frequently work directly with customers over a longer period of time to design and execute solutions that match their individual needs.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Margin_: Typically, distributors have smaller margins than system integrators, who may charge greater fees for value-added services and customization work.

    &#x20;

Ultimately, while distributors and system integrators both play key roles in the channel, their focuses and business models are very different. Distributors are concerned with selling products, whereas system integrators are concerned with selling entire systems and offering value-added services to their clients.

By carefully considering these factors, businesses can choose the right system integrator to deploy and integrate AI as a Toolkit. Properly selecting a system integrator will ensure the successful deployment and integration of AI, resulting in improved efficiency, better decision-making, and a competitive edge.

#### Developing a Marketing Strategy

In a previous section, we explained that AI as a Toolkit differs from AI as a Service regarding target audience and product characteristics. AI as a Service targets end users from specific businesses or developers and prioritizes usability, cost savings, and rapid deployment as the value proposition, while AI as a Toolkit targets developers and data scientists and prioritizes customization, control, and the ability to create more complex AI applications. As a result, this affects how value propositions and messages are crafted, marketing channels are chosen, marketing materials are developed, and measurement is done.

A marketing strategy is a crucial part of the go-to-market (GTM) strategy. After developing a product, the focus shifts toward how to make it known to the target audience, generating interest and driving purchases. Identifying the target audience is essential to both the GTM and marketing strategy stages, but the purpose is different. In the GTM strategy stage, it’s about identifying the target audience for the entire product development process, while in the marketing strategy stage, it’s about exploring the appropriate message framework for the selected channel and target market. To create a marketing strategy, several steps need to be taken.

The first step to creating a marketing strategy is to identify what you want to achieve. For example, for an AI toolkit product, the goals could be to get more developers to use it, keep current customers happy, and be recognized as a leader in the AI industry. You can set specific goals like getting a certain number of new customers, making sure current customers use the toolkit more, or writing articles about the product in industry publications or social media. For instance, you might set a goal to gain 500 new customers in the next six months to increase adoption among developers or write two blog articles every month to establish the brand as an AI thought leader.

    _Develop a marketing message_: The marketing message for an AI toolkit product should focus on how the product can help developers create intelligent applications faster and more efficiently than they could with other tools. The message should emphasize the toolkit’s ease of use, versatility, and compatibility with different programming languages and platforms. You may also want to highlight unique features that differentiate the product from competitors. Example: Our AI toolkit empowers developers to create intelligent applications faster and more efficiently. Its ease of use, versatility, and compatibility with multiple programming languages and platforms make it the perfect tool for any AI project. Our AI toolkit is designed by experts in the AI space and backed by years of research and development. With its cutting-edge features and intuitive interface, it’s the tool of choice for developers who want to stay ahead of the curve.

    _Select marketing channels_: To effectively market an AI toolkit product to developers, it’s important to choose the appropriate marketing channels based on their behavior and preferences. Online communities such as Twitter and LinkedIn may be effective in reaching developers who are active on social media, while webinars and tutorials can help educate developers about the benefits of the toolkit and how to use it effectively. Additionally, content marketing through blog articles and whitepapers can establish the brand as a thought leader in AI.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Create marketing materials_: The marketing materials for an AI toolkit product may include product demos, tutorials, code examples, and case studies demonstrating the toolkit’s capabilities and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. The materials should be high quality, engaging, and consistent with the brand’s voice and style. You may also want to create videos or visual content to showcase the product’s features and functionality. Example: Product demos that showcase the toolkit’s features and functionality, tutorials and code examples that show how to use the toolkit to solve real-world problems, and case studies that demonstrate the toolkit’s impact on businesses and organizations.

    &#x20;

In essence, education should be a priority, and you need to explain how your product works and its benefits as an AI toolkit. However, digital marketing may not be the best option if your target audience is the government. Instead, you can partner with an organization that has an extensive network in the government or join an association to distribute your message effectively. By tailoring your approach to your target audience, you can maximize the effectiveness of your marketing strategy and promote your AI product successfully.

CASE STUDY 3 (AI TOOLKIT): VISIONAIREVisionaire AI (visionaire.ai) is a product developed by Nodeflux, a leading computer vision company. It is an AI toolkit that integrates and deploys various computer vision AI models, such as face recognition, license plate recognition, crowd estimation, and vehicle classification. Nodeflux has identified that the product is too complex to be marketed directly to end users who may not have adequate knowledge of AI development and integration to appreciate its value. Hence, they have targeted their marketing efforts toward developers and data scientists, who are the main users of this product. Visionaire is an AI toolkit product that offers various computer vision models that can be customized to meet users’ unique needs (Figure [9-11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_9\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig11)). These models include object detection, object recognition, event recognition, and face recognition for images and video streaming.

Visionaire offers a highly flexible solution to deploy computer vision models that cater to various platforms, including Web, virtual machines, or bare-metal machines via containers (Docker). This ability to deploy on multiple platforms makes it easier for engineers to develop, test, and deploy models compatible with different types of cameras. By providing a solution that is not restricted to a specific hardware or software platform, Visionaire enables engineers to focus on developing their models without worrying about compatibility issues. The use of containers (Docker) ensures that the deployment of computer vision models is streamlined, as it allows for the creation of a portable and consistent environment for model deployment. This approach eliminates the need for additional setup or configuration, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing errors. Here are some possible use cases where Visionaire could be utilized:

* _Object detection_: A retail store wants to detect product placement on shelves to optimize stock levels and prevent stockouts.
* _Object recognition_: A manufacturer wants to inspect products on the assembly line to identify defects and reduce waste.
* _Event recognition_: A security company wants to detect and recognize abnormal behavior in surveillance footage to prevent security breaches.
* _Face recognition_: A government agency wants to verify the identities of individuals at border checkpoints to improve security and prevent illegal entry.

The Nodeflux team recognized that their AI toolkit product, Visionaire, was too complex to be marketed directly to end users who might not possess the necessary knowledge of AI development and integration to grasp its value. In response, they aimed to provide more than just a product but a solution that could seamlessly integrate into existing systems.

This led to the development of Visionaire as an integration platform, enabling easier adoption and implementation of computer vision AI models such as face recognition, license plate recognition, crowd estimation, and vehicle classification, among others. Over time, Nodeflux learned that the main problem in the Indonesian market was integration. Many existing CCTV systems were installed, and replacing them would be a huge task. Nodeflux knew that if they could integrate their product easily with existing systems, they would have a much better chance of success.

They worked hard to ensure that Visionaire could integrate easily with existing CCTV systems, regardless of the brand.

They also made sure that their computer vision models could be deployed on various platforms such as the Web, virtual machines, or bare-metal machines via containers like Docker.

This allowed maximum flexibility for their users, regardless of their technical expertise. Nodeflux’s efforts paid off. Visionaire quickly became the go-to solution for many industries, from government agencies to retail businesses. They had created a product that was powerful and easy to use and integrate. They had made computer vision technology accessible to the masses.

Today, Nodeflux continues to innovate and improve its products, always aiming to make them more user-friendly and accessible. They are proud to have made a difference in the lives of many people and businesses across Indonesia, and they know that they have much more to offer.

As Visionaire aims to provide a flexible and integrated computer vision solution to various industries, it becomes clear that they cannot do everything alone. They need partners to assist them with deploying, marketing, distributing, and packaging various analytics to solve many business problems. To address this, Nodeflux has implemented a signature partnership model called Nodeflux Catalyst, which offers three options to partners. These options include technology partners, value-added resellers, and distributors. The technology partners focus on supporting additional technologies and integration methods, while value-added resellers add value to Visionaire’s platform to create an end-to-end solution to specific business problems. Meanwhile, distributors are responsible for increasing product reach in specific markets and acting as Visionaire’s field sales team in different geographies.

Regarding the marketing strategy, Visionaire has focused on combined online and offline approaches. The offline approach is mostly through events such as exhibitions and in-person events. Due to highly complex and customized products, Visionaire requires high-touch marketing. Field sales are essential in explaining the product and how it works, leading to calls to action that lead to meetings or the website. Furthermore, SEO optimization focuses on education and commercial intent. While digital marketing and events are marketing channels for up-funnel leads, the contribution of field sales and other teams is crucial for sales.

In summary, Visionaire’s journey has shown that the product’s characteristics significantly affect how it is marketed and sold. Direct-to-consumer channels and self-service approaches would be disastrous for Visionaire if they were the main marketing strategies. Providing an end-to-end solution to a business problem is also a significant undertaking. Therefore, other entities are needed to create a comprehensive solution that the market can adopt.

### Conclusion

AI startups face unique challenges when bringing their products to market. Therefore, it’s essential to select an appropriate go-to-market strategy. There are three AI products: AI as a Solution, AI as a Service, and AI (as a) Toolkit. Each requires a unique approach to the go-to-market strategy.

For AI solutions, the go-to-market strategy should be comprehensive and focus on creating value, establishing a sales and marketing strategy, and identifying channels to reach the target customers. Customer support and appropriate pricing are also essential.

For AI as a Service, the strategy should focus on providing a robust platform that integrates well with the customers’ existing infrastructure, is easy to use, and offers clear documentation, API documentation, and support. The sales and marketing approach should focus on developers and businesses looking to enhance their products with AI capabilities.

For AI toolkits, the strategy should focus on providing versatile and sophisticated tools that can handle complex data processing tasks and enable developers to build sophisticated AI models. Detailed documentation, tutorials, and support must be provided. The sales and marketing approach should focus on technical audiences who are looking for advanced AI capabilities to build their models.

The go-to-market strategy is not a stage worked on in the middle of a company’s journey but is an initial foundation to observe how relevant the product is to solving business problems. The product character drives all existing elements, from the target customer, value proposition, and channel to the pricing model.

Partnerships are critical for AI startups to succeed. They can help with limited resources, market access, and technical capabilities. AI startups can partner with technology companies to integrate or develop new products, consulting firms for customized solutions, research institutions for expertise, or other AI startups to collaborate on new products or services. Investors and venture capital firms can also provide funding and mentoring. AI startups should ensure the partnership is a good fit for their goals and values and mutually beneficial and bring complementary skills and resources. Overall, partnerships are essential to the go-to-market strategy for AI solutions, AI as a Service, and AI toolkits.
