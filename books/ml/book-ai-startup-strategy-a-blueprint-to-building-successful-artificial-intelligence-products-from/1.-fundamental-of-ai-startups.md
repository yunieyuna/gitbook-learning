# 1. Fundamental of AI Startups

Artificial intelligence is a machine that can reproduce human cognitive capabilities and perform better than humans in scale, speed, endurance, and accuracy. Such capabilities include vision, speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), learning, planning, and strategy. They are made possible by the availability of large amounts of data, growing computing power, and improved learning algorithms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the backbone of many daily software applications and services. The technology behind these programs – machine learning (ML), neural networks, decision optimization (DO), etc. – has been around for decades, but it’s only recently that it has started to be applied in such vast numbers to products with AI at their core.

In a world where AI is rapidly being adopted in every single industry, it’s predicted that by 2030 this will have contributed about $15.7 trillion and boosted local economies by around 26%.[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1)

As the book is being written, generative AI, led by platforms like ChatGPT and Midjourney, has swept the world, revolutionizing interactions, content creation, and problem-solving. These large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact, create content, and solve problems across various domains. LLMs are a subset of generative AI, which uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text based on a given input or context. Transforming industries like marketing, entertainment, and education enables personalized content, automates tasks, and enhances creativity. This technology fosters efficiency and innovation and redefines human-machine boundaries, reshaping life, work, information search, and communication in the digital era. If you are reading this book, you are probably ready to be part of this revolution. Maybe you are already a product manager interested in building an AI into your product, or perhaps you are a data scientist who aspires to build an AI startup.

You may also be an experienced Software as a Service (SaaS) entrepreneur willing to join the AI bandwagon. You wonder how an AI startup with fewer than 30 employees can scale its solutions globally and exits for multimillion or even multibillion dollars.

In this chapter, you will learn about the fundamental concepts of AI startups. We will explain the foundation of AI technologies, the AI startup landscape, and AI product management and wrap it up with the patterns of successful AI startups.

### Historical Perspective: The Fourth Revolution

Over the last three decades, we’ve seen new platforms emerge that have created tremendous opportunities for startups: the PC platform in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, followed by the Web Revolution two decades ago.

Then mobile came around as the broadest computing device enabling people to do more than one thing at once – like checking email alongside reading news articles on their phone while listening to podcasts while answering messages. Yahoo, Google, and Amazon followed and rode the Internet and the World Wide Web Revolution.

In 2007, Apple released the iPhone, which defined the birth of the new era, the mobile wave. Facebook rode the wave, followed by some new companies that emerged and disrupted market leaders that did not innovate and adapt. Amazon disrupted Barnes & Noble before becoming the largest ecommerce platform, and Netflix disrupted Blockbuster before eventually also disrupting cable companies.

In the business software landscape, with the Web and Mobile Revolution enabling the SaaS proliferation, many cloud-based SaaS startups are born in multiple industries serving multiple value chains. The SaaS constituted business digitization and replaced Excel and papers with web-based applications. Enterprises are adopting SaaS at a rapid pace.

Then, the Fourth Revolution is coming.

In the 2010s, the advent of cheap GPU-based computing and cloud technology, which leveraged Internet-based compute, storage, and network, enabled new methods of scaling a deep neural network fed by a massive amount of data. This marks the new era of big data and AI/ML.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) enabled by big data technology have become game-changing technologies that are set to disrupt a wide range of markets due to their capability to imitate some cognitive aspects of humans to accomplish some tasks.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) are used interchangeably, but artificial intelligence is an umbrella for the replication of human intelligence in the form of software with machine learning as a subset. Machine learning is defined as a modern software development technique and a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

Around 2013, open source deep learning frameworks like Chainer, Theano, and Caffe were released, followed by TensorFlow by Google in 2015 and PyTorch by Facebook in 2016. These frameworks are an important factor in AI democratization, enabling startups to infuse some kind of intelligence into their products and transform themselves into AI startups.

With cloud technology adopted by enterprises, software giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azure started to look at data as the fundamental proposition and position themselves as big data and analytics providers.

In 2014, Amazon started to push Elastic MapReduce (EMR), while Google pushed BigQuery as a data warehouse on the Web. Microsoft took a different route by partnering with Hortonworks, a Hadoop-based big data startup, to release Azure HDInsight, a managed Apache Hadoop service in the cloud. They also launched Azure Data Lake Storage and Analytics.

Riding the AI/ML hype, they also released low-code machine learning services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Machine Learning in 2015, Google Cloud Machine Learning in 2016, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning in 2018 to make it easy for a nonspecialist to design, implement, and deploy a machine learning model in the cloud.

The tools and platforms mentioned are responsible for the birth of a new generation of startups, AI-powered or AI startups for short. Some entrepreneurs find creative ways to use these tools in their business models and products.

The rise in interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning over 2012–2014 has led to a dramatic increase in funding for these technologies. The venture, corporate, and seed investors started heavily funding AI startups in 2013 onward.

In 2022, a groundbreaking revolution emerged within the realm of artificial intelligence. The birth of ChatGPT, powered by advanced transformer technology, marked a turning point in the capabilities of AI. This state-of-the-art innovation facilitated a paradigm shift in natural language processing, fostering more nuanced, context-aware, and sophisticated interactions between humans and machines. As a result, ChatGPT has contributed significantly to enriching AI applications across various industries and domains, setting a new benchmark for the future of intelligent systems. The emergence of ChatGPT has ushered in a new era in the quest for artificial general intelligence (AGI). As AI systems progress, the pursuit of AGI – where machines exhibit human-like intellectual capabilities – becomes more feasible. Innovations like ChatGPT equip researchers to tackle AGI development challenges, signifying a notable milestone in AI research.

In just a few short years, artificial intelligence has gone from being something that was seen as far-fetched and unrealistic to becoming one of the biggest trends, if not _the_ biggest, in today’s world. Every day we read headlines about new advancements within this field, which brings it closer to reality than ever before. Whether you believe AI will happen sooner rather than later seems irrelevant because here we are at least taking steps toward its fruition! The United States alone invests $9 billion in funding for AI startups each year.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will remain a major trend in the coming years. According to Forbes, AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030.[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) The fundamental premise is that every company now strives to be an AI-first company, not just a data-driven one.

Historically and still widely practiced in many companies, the data always means transactional data stored in a relational database, which translates into a few dashboards for fundamental analysis of what happened to the business recently.

But to become AI-first, the data and artificial intelligence must be integrated into a set of business processes for analytical and operational purposes. This lays the groundwork for transforming into a smart, automated, and self-governing digital enterprise – where business metrics undergo real-time analysis, sales leads are processed automatically, inventory forecasting and ordering are automated, staff and vehicle scheduling is streamlined, AIOps monitors IT systems round-the-clock, customer churn is anticipated, and ad placements are optimized automatically. This disruptive AI-first movement has been enabled by close integration between data technology (i.e., big data infrastructure, streaming data architecture) on one side and AI (especially machine learning and deep learning) on the other.

### AI Startups vs. AI-First Companies

Let’s go back to the definition of AI startups and how it differs from another hype terminology, AI-first companies.[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3) An AI startup is defined as a technology company that leverages AI and data as a core differentiating factor to solidify its position and maintain an edge over competitors. Examples of AI startups are AI-first SaaS and AIaaS (AI as a Service). We will learn more about this in the next chapter.

AI startups should be differentiated from an AI-first company in different verticals that leverage valuable data from day one, use that data to train predictive models, and then use those predictions to automate and scale their work.

The main difference is that AI startups have the following:

1.  1\.

    The ultimate dependence on AI algorithms such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithm and Large Language Model (LLM) as their main products as well as their core technology.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    AI infrastructure and tools, such as hardware, end-to-end data, and an analytics platform or machine learning optimization tool, to accelerate and/or augment the implementation of AI-based solutions

    &#x20;

While AI-first companies use AI to leverage their main products and services, which can be anything from movie streaming and insurance to education platforms, AI-first companies usually do not develop their own AI platform. They just use ready-made AI platforms and tools and customize them to match their needs.

So AI startups sell AI as their primary commodities (sell side), and AI-first companies use AI to empower their value propositions (buy side).

An AI startup cannot function without AI. In contrast, an AI-first company is doing very well because of AI. AI-first companies can be traditional/tech companies selling products or services to consumers and businesses.

### Understanding Enterprise AI

Successful AI startups understand the nature of AI technology and how to package to a customer and sell it. They understand that AI is an enabling technology – just like the World Wide Web or microprocessor.

It is a revolutionary innovation that can be used to drive change to our fundamental assumptions, our behavior, the way we work, and even our culture. An interesting way of examining this definition would be discussing how the World Wide Web has changed some of the assumptions underlying software development and its distribution.

The Web has dramatically reduced the costs and delays associated with developing and distributing applications. The Web has enabled technology and business models of software such as ecommerce, social media, and SaaS, to name a few.

Another example is how microprocessor technology changed the fundamental assumptions of hardware design. The microprocessor, for example, changed the size, reliability, cost, and performance assumptions underlying hardware design. As a result, new applications and design approaches for hardware systems became feasible. The microprocessor enabled PC revolutions and later a mobile revolution.

On a smaller scale, a SQL database is also an enabling technology that allows structured data to be stored and queried in a tabular format.

This gave rise to enterprise resource planning (ERP), CRM (customer relationship management), and other software industries to grow worth billions of dollars today – just one example of how innovations like this change our world.

Similarly, artificial intelligence as enabling technology has enabled many use cases, such as automotive navigation systems that help self-driving cars navigate busy streets. AI is also used in nearly every industry, from detecting manufacturing defects, recognizing transaction fraud and stock trading, and reviewing the clauses in your legal documents. AI is an enabling technology set to revolutionize many industries, and as such, it will significantly impact how we do business.

Businesses are often at the forefront of adopting new technologies like this one; they’re looking for ways to become more efficient and succeed while reducing costs or increasing revenue margins through automation where possible – this is possible because of AI.

This is the reason the majority of AI startups are focused on solving enterprise problems. So most of the AI startups are selling to businesses (B2B), government (B2G), or application developers (B2D). Therefore, enterprise AI is an application of AI to solve specific high-value large-scale business problems. The AI can be infused into the organization’s business process in the value chain to give some kind of intelligence that will produce meaningful value.

The main function of enterprise AI is to improve and scale the quality and quantity of business decisions. A good business decision and actions will create business value. Forward-thinking enterprises are leveraging the power of AI to drive digital transformation. This is accomplished by combining sophisticated machine learning techniques with other forms of artificial intelligence, like classical rule-based systems or decision optimization, for an all-inclusive approach that results in increased revenue, reduced cost, and risk reduction throughout the enterprise value chain.

Enterprise AI is the core enabler of digital transformation. In the coming years, nearly every enterprise software application will be AI-enabled. Just as organizations today would not be able to conduct business without a CRM or ERP system, organizations will not be able to operate and compete without enterprise AI capabilities effectively. The AI capabilities for enterprises are also enabled by elastic cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Large organizations often require dozens to hundreds of enterprise AI solutions to address various use cases across their value chains. However, developing and deploying custom enterprise AI solutions at scale presents significant challenges, being time-consuming, costly, and often impractical. The vast amounts of data required, coupled with the specialized skills and expertise needed to create such systems, are beyond the reach of most organizations. For instance, obtaining a million facial images and hiring computer vision PhDs and seasoned security experts solely to develop facial recognition technology to authorize building access is not feasible. Instead, purchasing readily available off-the-shelf facial recognition solutions is a more practical approach for such organizations.

Similarly, there is little rationale for developing proprietary inventory optimization applications when sophisticated inventory analytics and optimization platforms already exist. These platforms are crafted by highly skilled PhDs who have developed patented algorithms for exceptional performance and efficiency.

This is where AI startups play a pivotal role. By offering specialized AI solutions, they cater to the diverse needs of various industries and organizations. By leveraging the expertise of AI startups, businesses can access cutting-edge technologies without the substantial investment required to develop in-house solutions, thus streamlining operations and fostering innovation.

The central premise of this book explores the strategies through which a startup can effectively capitalize on enterprise AI as a product offering. By examining methods to scale such solutions and, when the opportunity arises, successfully sell the startup for substantial returns, this book aims to provide a comprehensive guide for entrepreneurs seeking to create a significant impact in the AI market, potentially generating millions or even billions in revenue.

### Fundamental of AI Technologies

This work provides an overview of artificial intelligence, a collection of powerful algorithms employed by successful AI startups such as Waymo, Pony.ai, CrowdStrike, and Uptake Technologies. These organizations leverage AI to perform intelligent tasks, such as autonomous driving, preemptive cyberattack detection, and engine failure prediction. We delve into the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, acknowledging that AI extends beyond merely machine learning or deep learning. Since the 1940s, AI has evolved into a multidisciplinary science comprising various mathematical methods and algorithms.

For AI product developers, choosing the most appropriate algorithms from the extensive range of AI techniques poses a distinct challenge. AI is defined as the science and engineering of creating software and computer systems capable of performing cognitive functions typically associated with human minds, such as perception, reasoning, learning, planning, environmental interaction, problem-solving, and creativity.

This definition aligns with the perspectives of eminent AI scientists Russell and Norvig, who conceptualize AI as a software or application embodied within an intelligent agent. According to Russell and Norvig, AI encompasses the study of agents that perceive their environment and act based on those perceptions. Intelligent agents have been developed across various fields, including robotics for factory automation and autonomous vehicles, as well as in government agencies like NASA.

Going further in the business applications, the software as an intelligent agent employing these AI functions will likely obtain advantages and proficiencies in many areas, such as algorithmic marketing, algorithmic trading, automated manufacturing, autonomous vehicle operations, etc.

Most of these cognitive functions of an AI agent can be performed using the following exhaustive AI techniques:

* _Searching_: In artificial intelligence, search techniques are universal problem-solving methods to solve a specific problem and provide the best result. Many search methods include uniformed search, heuristic search, and heuristics function. Examples of applications are information retrieval domains such as Search Engine as a Service (i.e., Algolia, Meilisearch) and route optimization engines (i.e., Routific, Routyn, OptimoRoute, Optergon, etc.).
* _Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR)_: The knowledge representation and reasoning process is the mental act of deriving logical conclusions and making predictions from available data, usually in language. In artificial intelligence, the reasonings are essential because they allow for thought just like humans do – which helps create more complex computer behaviors when given various tasks at once. Several reasoning techniques include Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic, Knowledge Graph, and Fuzzy Systems. Reasoning and NLP (natural language processing) are also usually combined. The example applications are conversational design (Skelter Labs), fault diagnosis (Iconics), and medical diagnosis (Infermedica).
*   _Planning_: Planning tasks involve finding the best course for an artificial system, given its declarative descriptions. Another popular term for AI planning is decision optimization.

    A planner has some initial state, which transforms into the desired goal by applying actions in its environment. Some of the planning techniques are Constraint Programming, Markov Decision Process, and Goal Stack Planning, among others. The application examples are automated production planning (i.e., Productoo, MRPeasy), supply chain optimization (i.e., RiverLogic, anyLogistix), vessel planning (Innovez One), and automated rostering/scheduling problems (Deputy, EZShift).
* _Learning_: As one of the most fundamental and the most popular techniques of AI, learning is a process that improves the knowledge of an AI program by making observations about its environment. From a mathematical standpoint, AI learning processes focus on processing a collection of input-output pairs for a specific function and predicting the outputs for new inputs. Most of the basic artificial intelligence(AI) literature identifies two main groups of learning models: supervised and unsupervised. The techniques used in learning are machine learning, such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Bayesian network, and neural network with subsets such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. Applications of AI learning, for example, are predictive B2B marketing (i.e., 6sense, Demandbase), predictive maintenance (Uptake, Aveva), fraud analytics (i.e., Shift Technology, Friss), and cybersecurity detection (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne).
*   _Perception_: Perception in artificial intelligence is the technique of interpreting visuals, sounds, smells, and touch captured from the real world. Perception helps the software to sense, think, and react like humans. These algorithms have several applications, such as computer vision, which mimics how people see, and audio/speech recognition, which mimics how people hear. The perception algorithms are also applying learning algorithms like deep learning quite heavily. Some computer vision companies focus on video analytics (Viisights.com, Nodeflux.io) or medical imaging (Aidoc.com, Viz.ai). Speech recognition startups focus on speech engines (Vocitec.com, Deepgram.com) or conversation analysis (Prosa.ai, Invoca).

    Artificial intelligence products and applications can be divided into two categories: narrow AI, which can outperform humans in certain tasks, and artificial general intelligence (AGI or strong AI), which are theoretical systems that could do well at any given job.

Although the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has not yet been realized, numerous startups continue to make strides by creating AI products that incorporate advanced concepts such as lifelong (gradual) learning, open-mindedness, generalization/extrapolation of meta-learned algorithms, and generative AI.

Additionally, efforts to reverse engineer the neocortex, the most substantial part of the human brain associated with intelligence, have gained traction. Prominent AGI startups such as OpenAI, DeepMind, GoodAI, and Numenta are at the forefront of these innovations, pushing the boundaries of AI research and development. As AI technology, including generative AI, continues to evolve, the contributions of these startups are vital in advancing the field and bringing us closer to achieving AGI.

#### Large Language Models (LLMs) and AGI

The field of AI has seen tremendous advancements in recent years, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4, considered to be the first steps toward artificial general intelligence (AGI).[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4) These LLMs, based on transformer technology, exhibit a broad understanding of language and can generate human-like text, making them highly versatile and applicable to an array of scenarios.

However, the majority of AI startups focus on the enterprise sector,[5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn5) and there are compelling reasons for this. Enterprises today are increasingly digitized and generate a wealth of data that can be leveraged for valuable insights, process automation, and decision-making. Enterprises also have the resources and motivation to invest in AI technology that can enhance their productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.

While AGI-like LLMs promise a great deal of potential, they do have significant limitations when applied to the enterprise context. One major concern is their unpredictability.[6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn6) Enterprises need AI systems that provide reliable, predictable, and repeatable results. LLMs, in their current form, can sometimes produce outputs that are unexpected or hard to understand, which can be problematic in a business environment where accuracy and precision are paramount.

In contrast, traditional AI algorithms, often referred to as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), excel in this regard. These algorithms are designed for specific tasks and can be fine-tuned for predictability and precision. Their outputs are more easily controlled, and they can offer a high level of performance in their specific domains. This is why ANI continues to have significant potential and relevance for enterprise-focused AI startups. ANI systems can be custom-built to solve particular business problems, providing consistent and reliable results.

Looking ahead, AGI technology will undoubtedly find applications within the enterprise sector. Potential use cases could range from advanced data analytics, where the AGI could understand and predict complex patterns, to customer service, where it could understand and respond to a wide array of customer queries. AGI could also be used in strategic decision-making, simulating potential business scenarios and outcomes.

However, these applications will need to overcome the challenges of unpredictability and control. They will need to balance the vast capabilities of AGI with the precision, reliability, and explainability required in a business context. Until then, traditional ANI algorithms will continue to play a crucial role in enterprise AI applications. They offer an effective, reliable, and often more transparent way to leverage AI technology, making them an attractive option for AI startups targeting the enterprise sector.

### Enterprise AI, Analytics, and Automated Decision

There is a similarity in the goal of most AI startups: they are _enabling_ enterprise AI. Enterprise AI is the application of AI to speed up or automate decisions and actions to enable digital transformation, enhancing the organization’s value.

Enterprise AI is intersected with AI and analytics (Figure [1-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). The intersection of the three uses a technique such as machine learning (ML). The enterprise AI and analytics intersection uses decision optimization (DO) and business rule management system (BRMS) techniques.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_1_Chapter/522265_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1008" width="1063"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-1 </p></figcaption></figure>

Analytics is gaining knowledge and understanding from data that borrows methods from applied mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. Analytics can be broken down into three different stages described as follows and shown in Figure [1-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_1_Chapter/522265_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1442" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

* Descriptive analytics tells what happened in the past. We use a method like descriptive statistics and tools such as data warehouses.
* Predictive analytics predicts what is most likely to happen in the future. We use methods like machine learning, Bayesian networks, and deep learning to perform prediction and forecasting.
*   Prescriptive analytics recommends actionable decisions we can take to optimize outcomes. The methods used are classical operations research such as linear programming and integer programming, metaheuristics, and, recently, reinforcement learning.

    As it usually solves the same problem, this book uses analytics terms interchangeably with enterprise AI.

    The goal is to automate the decision in the organization. Automation and the automation of decisions can lead to immense efficiency, speed, or even new business models that were not possible before. For example, streaming companies like Netflix and Amazon Prime are enabled by recommendation systems. Uber and Lyft are enabled by automated fleet dispatch and route planning systems – without them these companies couldn’t operate as successfully with their current model.

    Fraud detection software also dramatically benefits from automating vital tasks such as credit card processing to save time on manual processes, which would take up valuable employee hours instead. Every day, companies and organizations make a large number of decisions that have concrete consequences.

    Artificial intelligence and analytics can be a powerful complement to human decision-making, but there are times when it is most appropriate. We can use AI to fully make the decision, augment the decision, or just serve as a decision support system (a 1980s concept), depending on the complexity and frequency of the decision. The difference is as follows:

    * _Decision automation_: The AI fully makes the decision using prescriptive or predictive analytics. An example is a fraud detection use case. AI systems swiftly analyze vast quantities of financial transactions to pinpoint potential fraud. The AI automatically flags or blocks suspicious activities by making real-time decisions using pre-established rules and patterns, effectively safeguarding banks and their customers from fraudulent transactions.
    * _Decision augmentation_: The AI recommends a decision to humans using prescriptive or predictive analytics. This kind of AI benefits from the collaboration between human knowledge/wisdom and the capability of AI to analyze a high volume of data at high speed. An example is in AI-assisted medical diagnosis. Algorithms examine medical images like X-rays or MRIs to identify disease indicators or abnormalities. The AI then offers recommendations to healthcare professionals, who leverage their expertise for the final diagnosis. This synergy between AI and human knowledge enables precise and prompt detection of medical conditions, enhancing patient care and outcomes.
    * _Decision support_: The AI practically only supports human decision-making enabled by data-driven insights provided by descriptive analytics. An example is in supply chain optimization. AI systems evaluate historical data and market trends to deliver insights on supply and demand patterns. Using descriptive analytics, the AI presents this information to supply chain managers, who leverage their expertise to make informed decisions on inventory, production, and distribution.

#### When to Deploy AI in Decision-Making

Whether AI can automate, augment, or just support the decision depends on two variables:

1.  1\.

    _The frequency of the_ _decision-making_: How often an organization should decide for a timeframe: one-off to a routine decision.

    &#x20;
2.  2._The complexity of the decision_: The predictability and interdependencies of entities in an organization or system. Decision complexity based on the Cynefin framework (see Figure [1-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig3)) consists of

    * _Simple decision_: Decision in routine, stable, and predictable situations; has a clear cause and effect.
    * _Complicated decision_: Decision in a situation that needs expertise or deeper analysis to identify cause and effect. It uses long-learned expertise with some known problem-solving frameworks.
    * _Complex decision_: Decision in a situation that involves multiple relationships, entities, and interdependencies. To make such a complex decision, one requires a 30,000-foot view analysis.
    * _Chaotic decision_: Decision to be made in a situation where the causes and effects seem random and difficult to map, with unclear interdependencies. Decision-making in this situation is mostly using experimentation or “gut feeling.”

    &#x20;

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_1_Chapter/522265_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="1183" width="1183"><figcaption><p>Figure 1-3 </p></figcaption></figure>

A company generally makes three types of decisions:

1.  1\.

    **Strategic decision**

    The board of directors is elected by a company’s shareholders and appointed for specific terms to ensure stability during their tenure on the board. These individuals make strategic decisions that have a long-term or material impact on the business, such as

    * Deciding where and when investments should be made (e.g., building new plants, more products, and services)
    * Defining strategies that help the company grow revenue overtime
      * How can I increase company valuation?
      * Adoption of employee benefit plans.
      * Merger and acquisition strategy.

    Strategic decisions are vital for a company’s long-term success. A board of directors has fiduciary duties, so it generally must act in the best interests of its shareholders with care not only now but also in perpetuity. The nature of the strategic decisions is usually one-off, complex, and chaotic; it needs a long contemplation and lots of support, data, and intuition. Automating strategic decisions is quite challenging. Therefore, AI products for strategic decisions usually help human decision-making or as decision support.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    **Tactical decisions**

    The senior managers make tactical decisions for the company. These are more detailed implementations of directors’ general strategy, usually with an impact on how things will look in six months to one year, such as the following:

    * Define optimal advertising channels.
    * Allocate purchases within a previously approved budget.
    * Define work assignments allocated to particular groups and people.
    * Plan a delivery route for the next two weeks.

    Most tactical decisions and plans are more detailed and certain than strategic decisions and plans. The tactical decisions are by nature more regular in frequency with the spectrum of complicated to rather complex. The most tactical decision can be semi-automatically assisted by AI (augmented decision).

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    **Operational decisions**

    The specialists and operators make daily operational decisions for the company. These are short-term, day-to-day matters that have an immediate impact on a business, such as

    * Allocating tasks to staff
    * Data entry of purchase order
    * Dispatching fleets of trucks
    * Allocating which ad to show to the viewer
    * Allocating machines in floor production
    * Executing stock trading buy and sell
    * Matching face with ID

    &#x20;

Operational decisions have a high degree of certainty and can be made quickly. These types of operational actions do not usually carry long-term impacts and are located in the simple to complicated spectrum, but they help with implementation within strategic or tactical decisions. The operational decisions are higher in frequency (routine). Hence, it is sensible to make it more automatic, given the data and constraints.

Humans do not optimally make these kinds of decisions because the frequency of these decisions is very large and the input parameters for these decisions are also complex.

AI products are targeted to augment/automate some tactical and operational decisions and support strategic decisions in the organizations (see Table [1-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1)).Table 1-1&#x20;

The Strategic, Tactical, and Operational Decisions

| Decision Level  | User     | Task                                       | Degrees             | Impact     | Complexity          |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| **Strategic**   | C-levels | Capital allocation, merger and acquisition | Supporting decision | Long term  | Complex-chaotic     |
| **Tactical**    | Managers | Allocating resource, planning ad channels  | Augmenting decision | Mid-term   | Complicated-complex |
| **Operational** | Staff    | Dispatching fleets, allocating staff       | Automating decision | Short term | Simple-complicated  |

Even operational tasks like car driving cannot be 100% automated without human assistance. AI is shining in automating and augmenting tactical and operational decisions, while for the time being, it is more as decision support for strategic decisions.

By the time this book was written, even the advancement of language models like ChatGPT (powered by Large Language Models), most AI products were not feasible technologically to completely replace humans, especially when complex cognition still is required (i.e., strategy development and management).

#### Automated Decision and the SETDA Loop

Any business makes money when they perform the right business action. As you can see from the previous section, this is the role of an AI. AI can help us support, augment, or automate our decisions, eventually directing us in which action to take. To understand how AI can be applied to help us with decisions and business actions, we need to understand AI at a high level. Just like humans, any intelligent agent based on AI follows the OODA loop model for decision-making.

OODA is an acronym for “Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.” It’s a model originally developed by American military strategist Colonel John Boyd for combat but has since been applied to business and general strategy fields.

The OODA framework defines the best practice for decision-makers to collect and filter data and identify and neutralize threats before becoming critical. Organizations use the OODA loop in business settings to benchmark their ability to predict, react, and continuously improve their decision cycles to obtain optimal outcomes.

The OODA applies to an artificial intelligence–powered product that helps businesses make a decision and perform business activities.

“Observe” can be understood as the acquisition of data. The product’s intelligent algorithm then “Orient” by making sense of the unstructured and disorganized data observations. The algorithmic product then allows our AI product to automatically “Decide” and “Act” or augment human engagement in these two phases.

Unlike the military purpose, OODA loops for AI products are driven by business outcomes: fraud risk reduction, customer conversion, employee overtime reduction, supply chain cost reduction, and so on.

We extend the OODA loops into a proprietary decision framework for AI products called SETDA: Sense, Explain, Think, Decide, and Act (see Figure [1-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)).

Sense is similar to Observe. Explain and Think are similar to Orient. Decide and Act are the same between OODA and SETDA. We categorize AI products by their capability to operate in one phase (or two phases) within SETDA loops:

* _Sense_: The phase of acquiring and transforming unstructured/structured data into information, knowledge, or wisdom
* _Explain_: The phase of summarizing, describing, managing, and visualizing data
* _Think_: The phase of learning, predicting, reasoning, and correlating from data
* _Decide_: The phase of planning, optimizing, and recommending some actions
* _Act_: The phase of performing some action, like choosing, moving, creating, driving, etc.

Any AI product usually operates within one or two phases on the SETDA loop. For example, computer vision (i.e., Nodeflux, Valossa) and speech recognition (i.e., Deepgram, Jasper) startups operate within the _Sense_ phase.

Startups operating in business intelligence and visual analytics, such as Geckoboard and Databoards, primarily focus on the _Explain_ phase. They utilize AI techniques like data mining and machine learning to analyze and visualize data.

In contrast, predictive analytics startups operate within the _Think_ phase, employing AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning to make predictions, as seen in credit scoring (e.g., Zest AI) and predictive maintenance (e.g., Aveva).

Prescriptive analytics startups concentrate on the _Decide_ phase, typically using machine learning and decision optimization techniques to optimize processes, such as supply chain optimization (e.g., Daitum) and demand forecast/inventory optimization (e.g., Antuit).

Lastly, autonomous robots and autonomous vehicle startups like Nuro and Embark operate within the _Act_ phase. AI startups that generate new content or products, such as creating new songs (e.g., Starmony), new materials (e.g., Kebotix), or new organic molecules (e.g., Molecule One), can also be categorized within the _Act_ phase (see Figure [1-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_1\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

### Conclusion

As AI has been immersed into our life as part of the Fourth-Wave Revolution, AI startups play an important role in the revolution as they will be the enabler of AI-first companies.

The role of AI in the enterprise is mainly to help businesses automate or augment the decision-making process. In the next chapter, we will explore the AI startup landscape and the fundamental of AI product management.

As we move forward delving into the AI startup landscape and examining the fundamentals of AI product management, we will gain a deeper understanding of the impact and potential of AI in shaping the future of businesses and our everyday lives.

#### Key Takeaways

* Companies can use AI to make the decision fully (decision automation), augment the decision-making (decision augmentation), or just support the decision (decision support).
* AI can help in strategic, tactical, and operational decision-making in the company.
* Cloud and big data technologies are the enablers of AI and the Machine Learning Revolution.
* Deep learning started to be democratized with the release of open source deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
* Every company is now striving to be an AI-first company, not only a data-driven company.
* An AI-first company means that the data and AI are integrated into the core business process.
* Artificial intelligence is an enabling technology for the enterprise, just like the World Wide Web is an enabling technology for the growth of the Internet-based business.
* The difference between an AI startup (AI-first SaaS and AIaaS) and an AI-first company is that an AI startup sells AI as a product (sell side) and uses AI to empower and scale its operational capabilities.
* AI is not only machine learning. Other AI techniques like searching, knowledge representation/reasoning, and planning are made to replicate human cognitive systems.
* Enterprise AI is the application of AI to speed up or automate decisions and actions to enable digital transformation, enhancing the organization’s value.
* Analytics is used interchangeably with enterprise AI and broken down into descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.
* AI products operate in one phase (or two phases) within SETDA (Sense-Explain-Think-Decide-Action) loops.
