# 6. Human-Centered AI Experience Design

In the previous chapter, we learned how to create an AI product roadmap. This is a tool that product managers and engineers use to plan the features and functionality of AI-based products based on user needs and demands. The roadmap helps ensure that the products align with the company’s strategy and vision. It can also be used to communicate with stakeholders about the planned features and their impact on the business.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of human factors that make it easy and intuitive for users to interact with an AI application. These principles include embracing customer needs, imposing trustworthiness, being ethical, and amplifying human capability. We will also learn about design principles that serve as guidelines for creating user-friendly and valuable AI products based on the research and work of experts such as Don Norman, Amber Case, and Motoharu Dei. These principles and the design thinking approach aim to create user-friendly and valuable AI products, which involve empathizing with the user, defining the problem, ideating solutions, prototyping and testing, and implementing the final solution.

By applying these principles and using design thinking, we can create a human-centered user experience design for AI products. AI user experience design is a process that focuses on the needs of users when creating products that rely on artificial intelligence. It considers how people will interact with AI-powered systems and aims to make those experiences as positive and easy as possible. By considering how users will input information, receive feedback, and navigate, designers can create intuitive interfaces that make using AI feel more natural. This is especially important in cases where AI is used to make decisions or recommendations, as users must have confidence in the system’s accuracy and trust the results. In short, AI user experience design ensures users have an excellent overall experience when interacting with artificial intelligence. Finally, we will demonstrate these concepts through a case study with an example of how to design the human interface for an AI-first logistics application.

### The Principles of Human Factors in AI

When it comes to artificial intelligence, human factors are essential for creating a successful product. Human factors refer to the various aspects of design that make an AI application easy and intuitive for users. Understanding user needs is critical in designing an effective AI solution, and translating AI capabilities into user-friendly solutions is essential to success.

By considering human factors, we can create AI applications that are truly helpful to users and solve their problems. In addition, by making our applications easy to use, we can help reduce user anxiety about using AI products and increase user adoption rates. Ultimately, incorporating human factors into our AI designs is the best way to ensure that our applications are beneficial and valuable to users.

There are several principles of human factors for AI products:

* Embrace customer needs.
* Impose trustworthiness.
* Be ethical.
* Amplify human capability.

#### Embrace Customer Needs

If we want to build AI applications that work, understanding customer needs should be at the top of our list. AI applications are designed to automate or augment human decision-making and to do this effectively. We need to understand what our customers’ needs and problems are. This is especially important when it comes to cognitive loads or the amount of cognitive work that a person must do to complete a task. If an AI application is going to relieve some of that cognitive load, it needs to know the customer’s problem in the first place.

Embracing customer needs is essential for any business looking to use AI applications. By understanding what our customers need, we can create applications that make their lives easier and help them achieve their goals. To embrace customer needs, we need to understand _w_hat the problem is, _w_ho has this problem, _w_hy this is a problem, and _h_ow humans solve one specific problem and then replicate the cognitive process to be performed by AI.

For example, in an AI-powered logistics application, the problem is it is challenging to plan the most efficient schedule and delivery route (what). The fleet managers have this problem (who). This is an impactful problem to solve because it can save delivery costs and time (why). An experienced fleet dispatcher intuitively knows how to build a delivery route with hundreds of vehicles and drivers with pencil and paper (how). This capability can be replicated in route optimization software such as _Routific_ and _OptimoRoute_.

#### Amplify Human Capability

We also need to understand the strength of AI in performing tasks. AI is better at some tasks, and humans are better at others.

AI’s real value is reducing human cognitive load and amplifying human capabilities.

Humans are powerful in cognitive tasks like thinking strategically and creatively, innovating things, connecting the dots, creating new concepts, and persuading people on a personal level.

Some tasks are better performed than AI, for example, analyzing huge and complex data, doing a repetitive job, and performing dangerous tasks for humans.

The key is to find an intersection of human strengths, user needs (tasks), and AI strengths, as shown in Table [6-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab1).Table 6-1&#x20;

Strength of Human vs. AI

|           | Strength                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Task                                                    | Example                                                                                                                                              |

Another important aspect is to differentiate between _augmenting_ and _automating_ tasks using AI. Augmenting means we are building assistive AI to help humans with their tasks, and automating means we are building autonomous AI to perform a particular task without human intervention. We need to understand the use cases and motivations for automating vs. augmenting some tasks (see Table [6-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab2)). Here are some examples:

* _Assistive AI_: A doctor uses a computer system to help with diagnosis by providing relevant information and data to which the doctor may not have access. The system assists the doctor in making a more accurate diagnosis.
* _Autonomous AI_: A L5 self-driving car can navigate roads and intersections without input from a human driver. The car is performing the task of driving completely autonomously.

Table 6-2&#x20;

Augmenting vs. Automating

|                                | Used When                                                                                                                                         | Motivation                                                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Augmenting (assistive AI)**  | <p>• Critical</p><p>• High stakes and regulated</p><p>• Enjoyable</p><p>• Extremely complex</p><p>• Technically infeasible</p><p>• High value</p> | <p>• Reducing cognitive load</p><p>• Greater control</p><p>• Improved job satisfaction</p>              | <p>• AI to help doctors with diagnostics</p><p>• AI to help lawyers find conflicting legal clauses</p><p>• AI to suggest portfolio optimization for investment managers</p> |

There are several aspects to consider regarding whether the AI system should augment or automate our tasks. We want the AI to augment the tasks with a high stake and that need to be regulated or too complex to handle by AI. We also do not want AI to automate the activity we enjoy, such as playing music.

Based on the preceding table, we want to use AI to automate tasks that we lack the ability and knowledge to do, such as correcting grammatical mistakes and improving our paragraphs for someone untrained in a particular language. Secondly, we would also want the AI to automate repetitive and tedious tasks with low value, such as counting cars and people. Lastly, the automated task should be dangerous, such as cleaning and detecting land mines on the battlefield.

We can also categorize AI (_assistive_ vs. _autonomous_) based on the SETDA framework previously explained. Assistive AI would only be able to help us _Sense_, _Explain_, _Think, and Decide_, while autonomous AI will help us _Decide_ and do some _Actions_ too (Figure [6-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)).

#### Embrace Trustworthiness

AI trustworthiness is an essential factor to consider when designing AI products. An AI can be well-intentioned, robustly performing as we envisioned, explainable, transparent, and safe to use. We must embrace AI trustworthiness to build our confidence in these systems and ensure they are reliable.

There are several examples of why embracing AI trustworthiness is important. One is the case of a self-driving car. If a self-driving car is untrustworthy, it could lead to accidents and loss of life. Another example is in healthcare. If a patient’s healthcare AI product is untrustworthy, it could lead to incorrect diagnosis or treatment.

Therefore, we must design AI products with trustworthiness in mind. Doing so can build confidence in these systems and ensure they perform as expected.

#### Be Ethical

Ethical AI is an important consideration for all AI applications. By incorporating ethical AI practices into our product design, we can ensure that our applications act fairly and do not expose user data. Some examples of ethical AI practices include privacy-preserving models and avoiding bias in decision-making.

Privacy is key in ethical AI. We must build models that cannot identify or infer details about individual users. This protects the user’s privacy and helps ensure that their data is not used in harmful ways.

Another important consideration is _bias_. We need to ensure that our AI models do not discriminate against people based on race, gender, or sexuality. This is important for ensuring everyone has an equal chance of benefiting from AI’s advantages. As AI continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is more important than ever that we ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly. With so much at stake, it is crucial that we take measures to ensure that the technology we develop does not have negative consequences for society as a whole. Some of the potential risks associated with unethical AI include

1.  1\.

    _Unfairness_: If an AI model is biased against certain groups of people, it could lead to unfair treatment and discrimination.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Privacy infringement_: If data is not properly protected, it could be accessed and used without the concerned individual’s consent. This could lead to a loss of privacy and personal information.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Automated decision-making_: If AI models are given control over life-altering decisions, there is a risk that they could make inaccurate or harmful decisions without human intervention.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Moral hazard_: If AI systems are used to make decisions on behalf of humans, it could lead to a loss of responsibility and accountability on the part of humans.

    &#x20;

Therefore, ethical AI is important and necessary to avoid these potential risks.

### User Experience Design of an AI Product

Applying design thinking is essential to design user-friendly and helpful AI products. Design thinking is a human-centered approach that helps identify user needs and envision innovative solutions. This approach allows AI products to be designed with the user in mind, making them more intuitive and valuable.

One example of an AI product using design thinking is Google Assistant. Its designers interviewed people who used digital assistants and found they wanted the assistant to be more personalized to their needs. As a result, Google Assistant was designed with features such as a customizable interface and personalized recommendations. Another example is Amazon Echo, which was developed based on the findings from user research. The team spoke to Amazon customers who used Echo and found out they wanted an assistant that could control all their smart devices at home. As a result, Amazon Echo was designed with features such as voice control and compatibility with different smart devices.

Thus, design thinking is useful for designing AI products as it considers both the users’ needs and the company’s business goals.

Another interesting example is how OpenAI developed their product ChatGPT. OpenAI developed ChatGPT using a “learn-as-you-go” approach, much like teaching a child. They started by showing the AI a wide range of Internet content and trained it to predict text patterns. Human feedback was then used to fine-tune the AI’s learning, enabling it to understand and respond accurately to user needs in various scenarios. They designed a collaborative system where humans supervised and managed the AI, ensuring that it continually improved. This thoughtful approach resulted in ChatGPT, a smart AI tool that can write text, choose tools, and even quality-check human work. Essentially, OpenAI uses design thinking methods, which involve testing, refining, and seeking user feedback in a repetitive process to enhance the product.[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn1)

Each of these products was successful because the designers took the time to understand the user needs and create a product that met those needs. By using design thinking, AI designers can create products that are both useful and enjoyable to use.

#### Principles of AI UX Design

Designers should keep a few fundamental principles in mind when it comes to user experience with AI products. First and foremost, the focus should always be on the human aspect – on solving problems for people – not on the AI algorithms and technology themselves. In addition, design thinking principles should be used to help create an intuitive, user-friendly interface. And finally, calm technology should be taken into consideration to ensure that the product does not require too much attention from users. By considering these things, designers can create delightful and user-friendly AI products.

**Design Thinking**

Design thinking is a human-centered methodology for creative problem-solving. It’s based on the idea that if you can understand a person’s needs and thoughts, you can develop better solutions to their problems.

Design thinking is very relevant to AI products. Many AI products are designed to solve specific problems, and it’s essential to understand the needs of the people who will be using them. Empathy, expansive thinking, and experimentation are all essential aspects of design thinking that can help make AI products more user-friendly.

Empathy is the ability to understand and feel what someone else is feeling. When designing an AI product, it’s important to put yourself in the shoes of the people who will be using it. What are their needs, and how do they think? What are their frustrations, and what are their hopes for the product?

Expansive thinking is the ability to see beyond the obvious. When designing an AI product, it’s crucial to think about all the ways it could be used and all the possible applications. Can the product be adapted to meet the needs of different users? Can it be used in different situations? Is there potential for growth and expansion?

Experimentation is the willingness to try new things. Being open to change and willing to experiment with different ideas is essential when designing an AI product. Sometimes the best solutions come from trying something that initially seems like a bad idea.

Design thinking is essential for designing AI product experiences because of the high level of technicality involved in AI. Focusing on the user and their problem, rather than the technology itself, is essential to ensure that the product is effective and meets the needs of those using it. Additionally, aligning all team members in a common direction helps ensure that everyone is working toward the same goal and that no one is working at cross-purposes. Finally, using design thinking to validate whether or not AI should even be used to solve a given problem can help avoid unnecessary implementation of this complex technology.

To create an effective and innovative AI product, it is important to understand the design thinking process from Stanford (see Figure [6-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig2)). This five-step process is based on empathy, definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_6_Chapter/522265_1_En_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="429" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-2 </p></figcaption></figure>

The first step, _empathy_, is about understanding the user’s needs and wants. You need to put yourself in the user’s shoes and try to understand what they are looking for. For example, when developing an AI product, you need to consider what features the user would want and how they would want to use them.

The second step, _definition_, is about figuring out what you want your AI product to do. It would be best if you defined the product’s goals and what problem it is trying to solve. This helps you determine what features to focus on and how to achieve your goals best.

The third step, _ideation_, is where you develop new ideas for your AI product. This step can be done by brainstorming with others or simply thinking about ways to improve your original ideas. It’s essential to be creative and think outside the box during this step.

The fourth step, _prototyping_, is where you start implementing your ideas. This can involve creating a basic prototype of your product or just sketching out how it will work. It’s important to have a rough idea of what the product will look like and how it will function before moving on to the next step.

The fifth and final step, _testing_, is where you put your prototype to the test. This involves testing out your product with real users and getting their feedback. It’s important to listen to what users say and make changes based on their feedback.

**AI UX Design Principles**

Design principles serve as a guide to interaction design. For AI interaction design, we shall adopt Don Norman’s six design principles, which are

1.  1\.

    _Visibility_: Make sure users know what the AI is doing and how it interacts with them. For example, the blue light ring turns on with Amazon Echo when the AI listens to you.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    _Feedback_: Let users know the AI’s actions due to their interactions. For example, with Google Home, after asking it to do something, it will read back what it heard and then either do what you asked or provide an error message.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Constraints_: Place limits on what the AI can and cannot do to prevent users’ confusion or frustration. For example, Google Home will only respond to certain questions and not others.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Mapping_: A clear relationship between control and effect should be created to create a smooth user experience. In other words, users should be able to easily understand how they can control the product and what impact their actions will have. An example of this principle in action can be seen in the design of Amazon Echo. When interacting with Echo, users can speak directly to it to control various functions, such as playing music or setting a timer. The clear mapping between control (speaking) and effect (the desired action) makes it easy for users to know what to do and ensures a smooth interaction.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Consistency_: Keep interface elements similar across different platforms and devices to avoid confusion on the part of users. For example, the layout of buttons in the Google Home app is very similar to that in the Google Home app for Android phones.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Affordance (clarity)_: Use clear labels and instructions so that users know how to interact with the AI product. For example, the Amazon Echo app has clear instructions for connecting your Echo device and changing settings.

    &#x20;

Don Norman based these principles on his observations of how people interact with the physical world, where human-centered design is an approach that puts humans’ needs, capabilities, and behaviors first. It designs around these things to accommodate them better.

Amber Case has proposed one additional principle for interaction design in the digital age: calm technology.[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn2) These principles can be applied to AI products to create a more user-friendly experience.

All of these principles are important when designing AI products. For example, if the goal of a product is to help people manage their schedules, then it should be designed with that purpose in mind. The interface should be easy to learn and use so people can get up and running quickly. Feedback must be clear so that users know what is happening as they interact with the product. Consistency ensures that users will have a predictable experience no matter which part of the product they use. Repetition makes it easy for people to remember how to use the product. And anticipation helps people plan their interactions and anticipate the consequences of their actions.

The calm technology principle is also vital for AI products. It refers to designs that minimize distractions and provide a sense of tranquility. This can be especially important for products that are used often or for long periods. For example, if someone uses an AI assistant to manage their calendar, they may not want interruptions while working on it. In this case, calm technology would ensure that the assistant does not pop up notifications or alerts that could distract them from their work.

Design principles from Don Norman and Amber Case provide a foundation for creating user-friendly AI products. By understanding these principles and applying them appropriately, designers can create products that are easy to use and offer a satisfying experience for users.

Another essential principle is actionable AI, which Motoharu Dei coins.[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn3) Actionable AI is an artificial intelligence technology that can provide specific actions a user can take to change the outcome. In the context of loan applications, for example, it could guide improving one’s credit score or what documents to submit to be approved. By providing clear and actionable instructions, actionable AI can help users improve their chances of success and make the most out of artificial intelligence technology.

#### AI UX Design Process Framework

In this section, we will use design thinking as the base for our framework to design AI user experience from _empathizing_ to _testing_ the AI product idea. The step-by-step and outputs from each stage will be explained.

**1. Empathize**

Empathize is the first phase in design thinking to understand more about the customer persona and problems.

**Steps:**

We will do the following steps in the _Empathize_ phase:

1.  1\.

    _Hypothesize_: We must build a hypothesis of the enterprise user persona at the strategic, tactical, or operational level because each level has different needs, problems, success metrics, and objectives.

    &#x20;
2.  2._Decide on the research methodology_: In order to decide on the research methodology to perform user research, one must first consider the hypothesis defined in point 1. Once these have been determined, the most appropriate research methodology can be selected. Questionnaires, in-depth interviews (IDI), focus group discussion (FGD), and contextual inquiry or ethnographic[4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fn4) research are all viable methods that can be used to understand the users deeply. Selecting the methodology that will provide the most accurate information to build an accurate user persona is crucial. Some of the critical questions that need to be answered are

    1.  a.

        Who are the users?

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        At what level are the users (strategic, tactical, operational)?

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        What are their success metrics and objectives?

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        What are their problems and pains?

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Acquire data_: Go out and perform data collection on real users.

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    _Data synthesis_: Data synthesis combines all the data acquired from the previous process to create a more complete and accurate understanding of the user persona, levels, needs, and specific problems. The information gathered from individual users is combined and analyzed to develop a more comprehensive view of the user’s wants and needs. This can help identify patterns and commonalities among users that may not have been apparent from studying individual datasets. Synthesizing data can also help prioritize needs and determine the most important problems to be addressed.

    &#x20;

**Output:**

The output expected from this step is we can get the persona of every enterprise user, such as:

* _Decisioning level_: Strategic, tactical, or operational
* Objective, problem, and pain
* Tasks and success metrics

We will use the persona data to create the hypothesis with the following format: _“We believe the \[target users] whose decisioning level is in \[strategic/tactical/operational] in \[target enterprise market] have \[problems] in finishing \[tasks] to achieve their goal in \[most important objectives].”_

**2. Define**

Define is the second phase in design thinking to understand more about the user journey and tasks.

**Steps:**

We will do the following steps in the _Define_ phase:

1.  1.Detail the enterprise user persona and mental model. The sub-steps are as follows:

    1.  a.Organize into persona groups:

        1.  i.

            _Strategic user_: Those who make decisions that impact the overall direction of the company.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _Tactical user_: Those who carry out the strategic plans of the company. They may not make decisions, but they implement the decisions made by the strategic users.

            &#x20;
        3.  iii.

            _Operational user_: Operational users are those who carry out the day-to-day tasks of the company.

            &#x20;

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Make the persona realistic by creating the character and their mental model. This is especially important for users who will be interacting with our products. We must ensure that the persona we create for these users is based on real-world data so that they act and think believably and naturally. If the persona and mental model are unrealistic, it can lead to negative user experiences. For example, suppose the persona we create for an AI product is too idealistic or unrealistic. In that case, users may feel they are not being taken seriously or treated as intelligent. This can cause them to lose trust in the product and even lead to them abandoning it altogether.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Similarly, if the mental models we create are unrealistic, it can lead to confusion and frustration among users. For example, if the task we ask an AI product to perform is too complicated for users to understand, they will likely become confused and frustrated. This can lead them to abandon or misuse the product in ways that could have serious consequences.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  2.Create an AI user journey map of the whole process to finish the core tasks. The sub-steps are as follows:

    1.  a.

        Divide by user persona decision level (strategic, tactical, operational).

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Define their touchpoints to finish their core task.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        Define problems and opportunities at every touchpoint.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Define how AI can help solve the problems in every touchpoint by automating or augmenting some of the cognitive tasks defined by the SETDA (_Sense, Explain, Think, Decide, Act_) framework (Table [6-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab3)).

**3. Ideate**

Ideate is the third phase in design thinking, which is brainstorming potential AI algorithms to solve a problem and the corresponding dataset needed to make those algorithms work. Ideation is integral to the design thinking process and can help teams develop innovative solutions to complex problems.

**Steps:**

We do the following steps in the _Ideate_ phase:

1.  1.From the user journey map in the previous step, we define AI opportunities for each cognitive task that can be automated or augmented by doing the following:

    1.  a.

        Define the category of the cognitive task within the SETDA (_Sense, Explain, Thinking, Decide, Act_) framework.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.Determine the AI solution plan and its feasibility. AI solution planning and feasibility analysis is a methodology for selecting the best AI models and algorithms for a particular cognitive task. It involves understanding how often the AI model needs to be updated and the trustworthiness expectation, such as fairness, explainability, and robustness. It also includes understanding possible errors that may happen by human users or the systems and how to mitigate them. Lastly, it evaluates the minimum performance our AI solutions need to contribute to real business values. Therefore, the components of these sub-steps are

        1.  i.AI model and algorithm category

            1.  1\.

                _Machine learning/deep learning_: Suitable for prediction, classification forecasting, and generative tasks

                &#x20;
            2.  2\.

                _Decision optimization_: Suitable for scheduling, allocation, and routing tasks

                &#x20;
            3.  3\.

                _Knowledge representation and reasoning_: Suitable for verification, validation, and audit tasks.

                &#x20;

            &#x20;
        2.  ii._Model update_: How often should an AI model be updated to remain accurate and performant? The frequency at which an AI model is updated can depend on a variety of factors, such as

            1.  1\.

                _Changes in the inputs (environment)_: If the environment in which the model is being used is changing rapidly, it may be necessary to update the model more frequently to keep up with these changes. This is also referred to as data drift; a change of the input data distribution to the model is being applied. Some inputs change rapidly overtime, such as house prices in a particular city, smartphone images, customer behavior, etc.

                &#x20;
            2.  2\.

                _Changes in the business process, rules, and regulations_: This is also referred to as concept drift, defined as a change in the underlying concept or relationship that the model is attempting to learn. An example is in vehicle classification. Some pickup trucks that were previously classified as trucks are no longer classified as a truck due to regulations, so the definition of what constitutes a truck changes as a concept.

                &#x20;
            3.  3\.

                _Degradation of_ _AI model performance_: Suppose the AI model’s performance degrades quickly overtime (usually due to complexity, unavailability, low quality of the data, or data drift). In that case, updating the model more frequently may be necessary to keep its accuracy.

                &#x20;
            4.  4\.

                _Accuracy vs. risk expectation_: How critical are the AI models for the business? Model updates must be performed frequently if it involves a huge amount of money or life risks when the accuracy is compromised. An example is the predictive maintenance model for aircraft engines.

                &#x20;

            &#x20;
        3.  iii._Trustworthiness aspects_: Trustworthiness is the level of trust expected of AI products to produce fair, unbiased, and explainable outputs. This is especially true for AI applications in critical use cases such as healthcare, finance, law enforcement, and aviation, where regulation, audit, and governance are strict. If an AI product has trustworthiness problems, it will eventually have legal issues. This is because people will not be able to trust the product to produce accurate results, which could lead to severe consequences in critical areas such as healthcare and finance. AI developers must ensure that their products are trustworthy to avoid these legal issues. Regarding errors in AI products, two types of errors can occur, human and system errors. Incorrect data entry, assumptions, or usage mistakes can cause human errors. On the other hand, system errors are usually caused by coding mistakes, unexpected software/firmware/API changes or updates, software glitches, or edge cases. No matter the type of error, it’s important to have a plan for how to deal with it. We need to have procedures in place for catching and correcting human errors. We need to have the plan to recover from system errors and prevent them from happening again. So the components of this sub-step are

            1.  1\.

                _Fairness and explainability_: Fairness refers to the idea that the outcomes of a model or algorithm should be unbiased and not disproportionately affect certain groups of people, while explainability refers to understanding and explaining how a model or algorithm makes its decisions.

                &#x20;
            2.  2._Risk and error_: Errors refer to mistakes or deviations from expected or intended outcomes, while risk refers to the potential negative consequences of an AI system or its deployment:

                1.  a.

                    Possible human and system errors

                    &#x20;
                2.  b.

                    Error risk and the path taken

                    &#x20;

                &#x20;

            &#x20;
        4.  iv._Minimum Algorithmic Performance (MAP)_: The Minimum Algorithmic Performance (MAP) concept is essential for businesses looking to adopt AI products. MAP defines the threshold at which an AI product is considered minimally effective and still provides acceptable business value for the users. In other words, MAP helps businesses identify when an AI product is ready for use and can provide tangible benefits. An example of MAP in action is using machine learning algorithms for fraud detection. A business may set a MAP threshold of 90% accuracy for its fraud detection system. This means that the system must be accurate at least 90% of the time to be considered effective. Anything less, and the business may not see a return on its investment in the AI product. MAP can simply be standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, but in my experience, it is better that the MAP can be directly converted into some business performance metrics, such as on-time performance, cost reduction, time saving, revenue increase, etc. MAP can also be used as a value justifier, which justifies the ROI of the AI system. The precondition is that the MAP promised must be aligned with the technical and commercial feasibility.

            1.  2.Define dataset planning and its feasibility. Dataset planning and feasibility ensure that the condition of data availability and the possibility to be acquired, annotated, and validated is feasible. This includes having an annotator with the needed expertise available at a sensible cost and defining the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process well and feasibly. By planning and assessing the feasibility of a dataset operation, we can ensure that our AI product is production ready. So the components considered are

                1.  i.

                    Data availability

                    &#x20;
                2.  ii.

                    Annotator availability and expertise

                    &#x20;
                3.  iii.

                    ETL process needed

                    &#x20;
                4.  iv.

                    Data validation

                    &#x20;

                &#x20;
            2.  3.Define a feedback mechanism. We must define a feedback mechanism that will be useful for our AI product improvement. The feedback mechanism consists of two different methods:

                1.  i.

                    _Implicit_: A measurement of how users behave when they are unaware that their actions are being monitored. This type of feedback is usually used to evaluate how users interact with an AI product to improve the design or effectiveness of the product. An example is measuring how long users finish a task or how often they misunderstand the data input instruction.

                    &#x20;
                2.  ii.

                    _Explicit_: When the user performs an action specifically designed to enable them to give feedback to the system. This might be something like rating a prediction quality. Another explicit feedback mechanism for AI products is _active learning_, which is a key part of the machine learning process that helps improve models’ accuracy by only asking humans to label datasets that are most uncertain. This reduces the amount of time and data needed to improve the model. Additionally, active learning can be used in a few AI applications, such as image recognition and natural language processing. The use of active learning in these applications helps improve the product’s accuracy and usability.

                    &#x20;

                &#x20;

            &#x20;

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

**Output:**

The output from this phase is an AI experience design canvas (see Figure [6-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig4)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_6_Chapter/522265_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="833" width="1418"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-4 </p></figcaption></figure>

**4. Prototype**

The next phase in design thinking is a _prototype_. Prototyping is a key part of the design thinking process. It helps us test our ideas and assumptions quickly and get user feedback. With feedback from users, we can then make changes to our prototypes and test them again. This cycle of feedback and iteration helps us create better solutions.

In the context of AI, end-to-end prototyping is especially important. Solutions that are built with AI (AI-first solutions) are quite complex. They need to perform their tasks well, but it’s also important for them to make it clear to users what they can and can’t do.

The main difference between traditional and AI-first applications is that the latter augment and automate a business process and a human cognitive capability. To make an AI-first application feasible as a business, we need to ensure it is production-ready and not only demo-ready.

In production AI, the last 20% takes 80% of the work.

Getting to the 80% drives a good demo, but the last 20% determines whether this AI-first application can be used in the real world or just for showing purposes.

The 80% is the usual UI/UX and basic AI models that satisfy the business needs (MAP, minimum acceptable performance).

The 20% is things such as dataset availability, ensuring the AI model remains accurate, edge case handling, human in the loop feedback mechanisms such as _active learning_, error handling, and explainability of the AI models.

So, if we don’t consider the last 20%, there will be only a dispute in the end.

Let me reiterate: if 20% is not considered, the AI business will only become _the business of dispute_.

Most AI businesses fail because they did an excellent job in 80% but failed to validate the 20%.

The consequence is that even just for prototyping, it must be thorough.

We need to be sure that our AI algorithms are meeting the users’ requirements, our model can perform well with the datasets we have, and they can handle the volume and variety of data we need to process. Prototyping allows us to test our algorithms on a small scale with limited data. This gives us a better idea of how well they will work. It is important to prototype your solution before committing to a full-scale implementation. Prototyping will allow you to test your assumptions about how AI solutions will be viable business- and technical-wise.

**Steps:**

We will do the following steps in the _Prototype_ phase:

1.  1\.

    _Gathering a development team_: Build a small team consisting of a front-end engineer, back-end engineer, UI/UX designer, machine learning engineer, data engineer, and dataset annotators to plan and execute the prototyping phase.

    &#x20;
2.  2.Creating the user interface design and wireframe of the AI application MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which considers

    1.  a.

        User input and validation

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        Instructions

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Feedback mechanisms_: Implicit and explicit

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        Explainability and transparency

        &#x20;
    5.  e.

        Error handling

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    _Creating an AI model prototype_: It is important to build a prototype of the AI model before creating the full-fledged model for production. This prototype will help us test and verify the acceptability of the performance of the AI algorithm using ground truth data. The AI engineers involved in building the prototype must be experts in machine learning, mathematical optimization, symbolic logic, or knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) models. The full-fledged AI model is created for production after the prototype is found to be acceptable.

    &#x20;
4.  4._Creating a data operations (DataOps) pipeline prototype_: Data is a crucial part of any AI solution. Therefore, it needs to be defined well. There are two important sub-steps:

    1.  a.

        _Manually collecting, annotating, and validating required datasets_: Datasets are the lifeblood of any AI, especially machine learning algorithms, including Large Language Models. The data’s quality and accuracy can determine an AI product’s success or failure. To build a viable AI product, it is essential to start with high-quality data. This data must be correctly annotated so the algorithms can learn from it. The data will not be useful for training the AI models without accurate annotation. Validation is also important to ensure that the data is correct and representative of the real world. Incorrect data can lead to faulty AI models that produce inaccurate results. It is, therefore, critical to take the time to get the right data and to annotate it accurately if we want to build a successful AI product. We treat the annotated dataset as a ground truth, which will help us evaluate and validate the AI model performance developed by machine learning engineers. After manual steps have been performed, the data annotation team collaborates with data engineers to do the next step.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Building a_ _DataOps pipeline prototype, which is a framework that helps manage data_: It provides a backbone for streamlining the lifecycle of data acquisition, aggregation, annotation, preparation, management, and development for AI, machine learning, and analytics. The prototype of data operations must be developed by data engineers assisted by machine learning engineers and data annotators. This is important because it allows for better data management and helps ensure that the DataOps pipeline is realistic and ready for production.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    _Creating a front-end prototype_: This is an implementation of a user interface (UI) design that lets users interact when using the AI product. This includes designing the layout of the UI, as well as developing interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and maps. The UI must be visually appealing and intuitive.

    &#x20;
6.  6\.

    _Creating a back-end prototype_ _responsible for the infrastructure used to host and run the AI product_: The infrastructure can include both cloud-based and on-premise servers, depending on the need and requirements. Other tasks include developing API that allows the front end, data platform, and AI models to communicate with the back end and developing the logic, workflow, and algorithm that power the AI product. In addition, the back end of an AI product may also include data processing and storage infrastructure, such as a database or data warehouse, to support the storage and manipulation of large datasets.

    &#x20;

**Output:**

The output from this phase is as follows:

1.  1\.

    _Application mockup_: Web, mobile, or desktop application with a clean and instructive user interface

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    AI models

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    Dataset along with its ground truth data

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Data operations pipeline prototype

    &#x20;

The preceding components are the building blocks expected to satisfy user needs and help them augment or automate their cognitive tasks (Figure [6-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig5)).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781484295021/files/images/522265_1_En_6_Chapter/522265_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="" height="567" width="1063"><figcaption><p>Figure 6-5 </p></figcaption></figure>

**5. Test**

The testing phase is the phase in which the prototype is put in the hands of users (beta testing), and their feedback is analyzed to see if the AI performance is acceptable and provides real business value for the three types of users: strategic, tactical, and operational. Another way to test AI is by analyzing its performance against certain benchmarks or goals. This helps us determine whether the AI is meeting expectations and if there is room for improvement. Some examples of using AI testing include:

* Testing how well an AI can predict future events
* Testing how accurate an AI’s image recognition is
* Analyzing how well an AI can recommend products or services
* Seeing how efficiently an AI can automate a task

**Steps:**

We will do the following steps in the _Test_ phase:

1.  1\.

    The first step in the testing phase of an AI prototype is to put the prototype in the hands of users and let them interact with the user interface. This allows users to get a feel for how the AI works and how it can be used in their business.

    &#x20;
2.  2\.

    After users have had a chance to interact with the prototype, they are then allowed to try out the AI models and judge their accuracy and business values. This step allows businesses to see if the AI can provide accurate results that are valuable to their operations.

    &#x20;
3.  3\.

    After users have tested the AI models, any errors, unfairness, or inconsistencies in the results need to be analyzed. By identifying these issues, developers can work to correct them and improve the accuracy of the AI models. The users can fill the AI solution testing canvas as shown in Figure [6-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig6).

    &#x20;
4.  4\.

    Once all issues have been corrected, comparing the test results with some baseline from a public dataset or competitors is important. This will give businesses a good idea of how well the AI solution performs compared with other solutions on the market.

    &#x20;
5.  5\.

    Finally, the development and business teams must evaluate whether the AI solution can be used in a real-world setting. If it is determined that the AI solution provides real business value, businesses can begin using it in their operations. We define technical feasibility based on the preceding constraints from the AI model and dataset perspective. To determine the feasibility, we must consider the team capability, technology support, and infrastructure needed to build and operate the AI solution. The cost will be concluded to run and operate this AI solution. The main question is, can we make it commercially viable or not?

    &#x20;

CASE STUDY: USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN FOR AN AI-POWERED LOGISTICS PLATFORM

David, a seasoned veteran in logistics with more than 25 years of experience in operations and business development in logistics companies, with his friend Tom experienced in operations research and analytics for supply chain management and logistics, decided to build _Optitrax_, a startup that builds an AI-powered logistics application to optimize logistics operations. Following the framework in Chapter [3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_3\_Chapter.xhtml), David and Tom quit their jobs to start their venture by working as logistics technology consultants and establishing their consulting firm, developing an application powered by analytics for logistics operations, from inventory to last-mile logistics. They found problems in the niche market in last-mile logistics and thought that AI could really be applicable to boost logistics operations’ efficiency.

After analyzing the market size and doing in-depth interviews, they finally found an early adopter, Safe Logistics, a medium-sized logistics company with a last-mile logistics business unit. They can convince this company to pay for the AI-first logistics application _Optitrax_, if they can prove that this solution is helpful with the metrics agreed upon by both. So they build a prototype with good experience design to validate the customer needs and requirements. They follow the design thinking process and perform these steps:

1.  1\.

    Empathize

    Based on his years of experience running logistics operations, David has a preconceived notion that tactical and operational users can benefit from intelligent logistics applications powered by AI. He contacts his logistics industry networks to further validate his notion and does in-depth interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups with his ex-partners and colleagues. Then, he analyzes and synthesizes the data and talks with the potential users of Safe Logistics, a logistics company.

    He comes up with the hypothesis for two types of users as follows:

    *   Tactical users (fleet managers)

        > _“We believe the_ _**fleet managers**_ _whose decisioning level is_ _**tactical**_ _in_ _**logistics companies**_ _have_ _**inefficiencies**_ _in finishing_ _**logistics routing and scheduling**_ _to achieve their goal in_ _**minimizing operational cost and delivery time**.”_
    *   Operational users (couriers)

        > _“We believe the_ _**couriers**_ _whose decisioning level is_ _**operational**_ _in_ _**logistics companies**_ _have_ _**forecasting problems**_ _in finishing_ _**logistics delivery**_ _to achieve their goal in_ _**minimizing delivery time and optimizing customer satisfaction**.”_

    The persona based on the two types of users will be further detailed in the next step.

    Define

    Combining the information gathered and synthesized from the in-depth interviews, questionnaires, extensive literature review in the last-mile delivery industry, and focus groups with personal experience managing logistics operations, David and his team create two different personas. One is the logistics manager (Figure [6-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig7)), and the other is the courier (Figure [6-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig8)).

The logistics manager and courier personas are the ones who will become the primary Optitrax regular users. They will have the most benefits from this AI application. Understanding their personas, including their age, personality, education level, job description, goals, KPI, role, and pain points, is instrumental in deciding which features and capabilities should be prioritized.

After creating the personas, David and his team create an AI user journey map for both tactical users (logistics managers; see Table [6-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5)) and operational users (couriers; see Table [6-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab7)), which outlines the steps and cognitive tasks needed to complete the core task from start to finish.Table 6-5&#x20;

By analyzing the user journey map, they will understand more about the touch points and their related tasks, along with current practices and pain points.

To find an opportunity where AI can be applied, they break down further the tasks into cognitive tasks according to the SETDA (_Sense, Explain, Think, Decide, Act_) framework (Figure [6-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig1)). The goal is to understand whether the tasks can be categorized into cognitive tasks, which can be automated or augmented by AI. Usually, a task categorized as _Sense_, _Think,_ and _Decide_ is a low-hanging fruit for AI applications. Augmentation of the cognitive task using AI will greatly reduce the users’ cognitive loads, reducing errors and improving efficiency. The cognitive tasks for the logistics managers and their AI opportunities are listed in Table [6-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab6).Table 6-6&#x20;

    Ideate

    After creating the personas and AI journey map for each persona based on questionnaires, interviews, and literary analysis of the last-mile delivery industry, David and his team start to brainstorm potential AI algorithms to solve the user problem by augmenting or automating some of their tasks. They also need to consider other important aspects such as datasets, trustworthiness, possible errors, and minimum acceptable performance (MAP). The steps are as follows:

    1.  1\.

        Based on the user journey map depicted in Table [6-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab5), the team then categorizes the tasks into SETDA cognitive tasks for the logistics manager.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;

Based on these, AI can help with several tasks related to logistics management, such as

* Matching vehicles and couriers with delivery areas
* Automatically creating routes and schedules
* Notifying the logistics manager if there are any issues with delivery operations

In other words, AI can assist logistics managers by streamlining and automating various tasks and providing alerts for any problems during delivery.

The process is repeated from the courier’s perspective, so the user journey map for the courier is defined in Table [6-7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab7).Table 6-7&#x20;

Then, whether AI can be applied to augment the cognitive task is decided (Table [6-8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab8)).Table 6-8&#x20;

From the preceding table, we can see two possible applications of AI: nowcasting potential traffic or weather changes and automatically rerouting in case it is needed.

The team is picking cognitive tasks that AI will augment or automate. Based on the previous tables, there are three possible AI opportunities:

1.  a.

    AI to match the courier with a delivery area (for the logistics manager)

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    AI to route and schedule deliveries (for the logistics manager)

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    Dynamic rerouting by nowcasting the changes of the situation (for the courier)

    &#x20;
4.  2.Determine the AI solution plan and feasibility for the AI opportunities described. In this step, the team analyzes

    1.  a.

        _Possible AI model and algorithms_: The team determines the most suitable algorithms or AI model for each opportunity. AI can help match couriers to delivery areas using unsupervised machine learning techniques such as clustering. Clustering groups couriers and delivery areas into separate clusters, each representing a delivery area. This can be useful when data is not readily available. When enough past delivery data is available, supervised machine learning methods such as SVM and AdaBoost can predict optimal assignments based on input features (e.g., courier performance and experience, delivery area characteristics).

        For the optimization of delivery routing and scheduling, the team uses a combination of mathematical optimization algorithms such as linear programming, mixed integer programming, or heuristics such as the _Clarke-Wright savings algorithm_ and machine learning techniques such as _neural networks_ or _graph machine learning_. Graphs are useful for representing complex data with relationships between entities such as delivery points, vehicles, and routes. _Graph machine learning_ algorithms can be used to learn from this data and make predictions or decisions based on the relationships in the graph, such as the most efficient routes based on distance, traffic, and the availability of delivery vehicles, also predicting the time it will take for a delivery to be completed.

        For rerouting the courier due to new events such as accidents or traffic, it is necessary to use more dynamic algorithms that can quickly adapt to environmental changes. This could involve machine learning techniques such as _online learning_ or _reinforcement learning_ to update the model as new data becomes available continuously. Of the three AI models, the delivery rerouting has the highest complexity.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _How often should the AI model be updated_: Three things are affecting model update frequency: how often the inputs (environment) and business process/regulations/rules are changing, how complex the AI model is, and how risky the model’s inaccuracy is. For the courier matching algorithm, the machine learning model is quite simple, the environment and business process are also not changing rapidly (how often would the company change the couriers and delivery/pickup regions), and the risk of accuracy is not severe. The risk of mismatching the couriers with delivery areas is rather small. The AI models needed for automated routing and scheduling optimization are quite complex, involving machine learning and mathematical optimization. The inputs and business processes also vary from company to company. Therefore, frequent model update is necessary. Finally, for the courier rerouting, the model complexities are high, and the environmental inputs, such as traffic conditions and road closures, are also changing rapidly. Therefore, for this kind of model, a method like online learning is necessary, in which the model is trained and updated as new data becomes available rather than being trained on a fixed dataset.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _Trustworthiness_: The team is analyzing the needed trustworthiness for each AI model that will be developed. The components are fairness, explainability, possible risks, and errors. The main consideration is especially if our AI models must deal with regulatory and audit processes. The Optitrax team is discussing that fairness and explainability are not crucial for the courier matching model as long as the model decision can be traced to how the courier is assigned to a particular delivery area in a proportional amount of work. The error risks are not very significant. If the AI model mismatches the right courier to the delivery area, the worst that can happen is the delivery will take more time. AI can help with delivery routing and scheduling by suggesting routes and schedules that consider various factors such as traffic, road closures, and weather conditions. The model’s decisions don’t need to be fair or easily explained as long as the inputs that influence the recommendations can be traced and understood. The risk of error is also not very severe. In the worst case, if the scheduling and routing are not optimal, an additional cost will be incurred, and customer satisfaction will be reduced (due to late delivery). As for the dynamic rerouting, explainability and fairness are not crucial as long as the courier is always informed about why the route is altered (Figure [6-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig9)). The risk of error is also moderate, as wrong rerouting will only impact courier’s time and cost.

1.  d.

    _Minimum Algorithmic Performance (MAP)_: The main performance metrics of each algorithm need to be set first. For the courier–delivery area matching, the performance metric selected is on-time performance, which tracks the delivery times for a sample of shipments and calculates the percentage that was delivered within the desired time frame. After a discussion with the business team, the expected OTP is defined to be 90%. This is the MAP of the courier matching model. The performance metrics for delivery scheduling and routing optimization are reducing the distance traveled, planning time, and operational cost. The MAP is a 20% reduction in distance traveled, a 40% reduction in planning time, and a 20% reduction in operational cost after using the AI system. Lastly, the performance metrics for dynamic rerouting are decided to be fuel reduction. The MAP is fuel reduction of 20% and improving customer satisfaction by 20% after using the AI system.

    &#x20;

The summary is shown in Table [6-9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab9).Table 6-9&#x20;

1.  2._Dataset planning_ _and its feasibility_: Another important thing is the planning and feasibility of data needed to feed to the AI system. The Optitrax team must be mindful of potential impediments like limited data and annotator resources to ensure smooth data operation. Several components need to be assessed, such as

    1.  a.

        _Data availability_: The Optitrax team is analyzing the data availability. For logistics delivery applications, some of the data is always available from paid and public APIs. But some data must be annotated manually by a trained annotator. The data needed is the performance of each courier, the delivery time, weather, traffic, big events (concerts, sports, etc.), accidents, disasters (floods, typhoons), road closures, and other traffic regulations such as road classes for different vehicle types.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        _Annotator availability and expertise_: The _Optitrax_ team determines the annotators needed and classification. The annotator may annotate data such as road closures and road classes, which change over time, but machine learning is not always used in delivery routing. Hence, annotators are not always necessary for developing delivery routing algorithms. One or two annotators are sufficient. Moreover, annotators do not need to have special qualifications for the logistics use case, except maybe some basic knowledge in logistics and deliveries.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        _ETL (Extract-Transform-Load)_: The _Optitrax_ team analyzes the ETL system needed. The _Extract_ step involves collecting data from order management applications, spreadsheets, and APIs. The data might include information on delivery points, vehicle types, weather, traffic conditions, and other relevant inputs. In the _Transform_ step, the data is preprocessed and formatted. In the _Load_ step, the data is loaded into a database or in-memory database for further analysis. The _Optitrax_ team decides that the ETL system is based on Kafka and Spark. Kafka is used to ingest data from various sources, which is then transformed by Spark. The processed data is then loaded into the target system, an in-memory Redis database.

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        _Data validation_: In this step, the _Optitrax_ team defines a data validation mechanism where a data validator validates the annotated data related to deliveries, such as the delivery time, OTP, and other data. Some outliers can be checked and verified to make sure the data is reliable for machine learning training.

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  3._Feedback mechanism_: The _Optitrax_ team defines implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms that could be used by delivery scheduling and routing applications to gather feedback from logistics managers and couriers. Some examples include

    1.  a.Implicit feedback mechanism

        1.  i.

            _User usage_: Tracking how often the logistics managers use certain features, such as courier matching, routing, and scheduling planning. We can track whether couriers use the dynamic rerouting feature or prefer to decide the route themselves.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _User behavior_: Tracking the user behavior to identify patterns and trends in how the application is being used, such as how long the logistics manager spent time matching the courier with the delivery area, planning the route, and dispatching the orders to the couriers. For the courier, the behavior could be tracked, for example, how they use the whole application, from receiving the orders to following the route or reroute suggested by the AI system.

            &#x20;

        &#x20;
    2.  b.Explicit feedback mechanism

        1.  i.

            _Surveys_: The application could include surveys or polls that allow users to provide feedback on specific features or their overall experience with the application. For the logistics manager, these could be triggered after certain events, such as the completion of the whole delivery task at the end of the day. For the courier, this could be triggered after the completion of delivery to the customer at the end of the shifts.

            &#x20;
        2.  ii.

            _Rating and reviews_: Users could be given the option to rate or review specific features or the whole application after completing tasks.

            &#x20;
        3.  iii.

            _Active learning_: Active learning is a way to improve the accuracy of a machine learning model by involving a user in the learning process. This can be done by showing the user a series of predictions made by the model and asking them to rate the accuracy of each prediction. For example, in a logistics system, the user (e.g., a logistics manager) might be shown the system’s predictions for which courier should be assigned to which delivery area and be asked to rate the accuracy of those predictions. This feedback can then be used to improve the model’s performance. The feedback from the logistics manager will improve the accuracy of the courier matching model. An example of active learning is shown in Figure [6-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig10).

    _Customer support_: The application could provide a customer support channel, such as chat or email support, where users can ask questions or provide feedback.

    Prototype

    Based on the preceding AI user experience canvas, which summarizes the results from interviews and brainstorming sessions, the _Optitrax_ team develops a complete prototype for the AI logistics solution. The steps they perform are as follows:

    1.  a.

        The whole development team is gathered, from UI/UX designers to data engineers and scientists. The whole prototyping process must involve the whole team with the following RACI led by the product manager as an accountable person (see Table [6-10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Tab10)).

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
2.  b.

    _Creating the_ _user interface design_: Using the AI user journey canvas as a reference, the UI designer of _Optitrax_ designs the end-to-end wireframe of the logistics solution.

    &#x20;
3.  c.

    _Creating the_ _AI model prototype_: The machine learning and algorithm engineers are working with dataset annotators and data engineers to build an AI model prototype that meets minimum acceptable performance (MAP) defined in the previous step.

    &#x20;
4.  d.

    _Creating the data operations (DataOps) pipeline prototype_: The data engineers are building a data acquisition and integration platform that gathers real-time data from the API, such as mapping, distance matrix, weather, and traffic, which will be used as training data for the AI models.

    &#x20;
5.  e.

    _Creating front end_: The front-end software engineer then implements the user interface designed by the UI designer as a web application for logistic managers (Figure [6-12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig12)) and a mobile application for couriers (Figure [6-13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig13)).

1.  f.

    _Creating back end_: The back-end engineer is building a prototype of cloud-based infrastructure with a database integrated with AI models and a data platform.

    &#x20;
2.  5\.

    Test

    After the end-to-tend prototype has been developed, it is the time to put it in the hands of users (beta test), where they can interact with and use it for real-world logistics operations. These are the steps in this phase:

    1.  a.

        The _Optitrax_ team shows the web and mobile application to the Safe Logistics team and teaches them how to use the application to manage their logistics operations.

        &#x20;
    2.  b.

        The Safe Logistics team consists of logistics managers and couriers. They test the _Optitrax_ application to deliver to real customers by managing their orders.

        &#x20;
    3.  c.

        After the Safe Logistics staff have tested the platform, the test results are then compiled into the AI solution testing canvas (Figure [6-14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-startup-strategy/9781484295021/html/522265\_1\_En\_6\_Chapter.xhtml#Fig14)) along with the score, which is rated from 1 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).

        &#x20;
    4.  d.

        The verdict is that the prototype has been deemed acceptable for production use. So it is technically feasible. But Safe Logistics wants the pricing to be less than the business value created (cost savings and time to plan and deliver).

        &#x20;

    &#x20;
3.  e.

    Now with that pricing and cost of scaling the marketing, development, and operation, David and Tom, as the Optitrax founders, must calculate whether Optitrax is a viable business as AI-first SaaS or not.
