# 15. Going Further

## Chapter 15. Going Further

This book has aimed to lay a solid foundation for you to build upon. If you’ve come this far, you have covered a lot of ground, but there’s still much more to learn.

Fortunately, there’s a vast community of people who are eager for you to succeed and willing to lend a hand. Regardless of how good the platform is, the applications that run on it are only as good as the people who build them. The most daunting task any platform faces is not just attracting skilled individuals but also nurturing their success. This is true for Google Cloud as well; a scarcity of necessary skills can make organizations apprehensive about adopting the platform.

In 2021, for instance, Google pledged to equip 40 million people with [Google Cloud skills](https://oreil.ly/RcKgL). That is a huge number, equivalent to the entire population of California. From my perspective, Google is addressing this by promoting four key areas for Google Cloud learning:

* Professional certification
* Online learning resources
* Community groups
* Conferences and events

## Professional Certification

Google, in line with other cloud providers, offers certifications on many facets of Google Cloud. These certifications are structured into general certifications and specialist certifications, which align with the common job roles in the industry.

Each certification requires passing an exam that is normally two hours long. The exam typically consists of 50–60 multiple-choice or multiple-select questions. However, don’t be fooled into thinking that the exams are easy. The questions are designed to test your knowledge and understanding of the platform, often requiring you to make a judgment on the best answer from several possible options. The questions are not designed to trick you but to make you think. They are not designed to test your ability to remember facts but to test your ability to apply your knowledge to solve problems.

A third-party provider administers these exams. Professional-level exams are priced at $200 plus tax (as of the time of writing); the Associate Cloud Engineer costs $125 and the Cloud Digital Leader is around $90. All these exams can be undertaken either at a testing center or from the comfort of your home, with a remote proctor overseeing the process via your webcam. Further information about the exams and registration can be found on the [certification site](https://oreil.ly/z0lP4).

The Cloud Digital Leader certification serves as the entry point. It is a foundational-level exam intended for individuals with no prior Google Cloud experience. It is a good place to start if you are new to Google Cloud; this certification is often pursued by less technical people wishing to grasp the basic understanding of Google Cloud. Nonetheless, it requires a surprisingly broad understanding of the diverse products and services Google Cloud provides.

The Associate Cloud Engineer certification is the next tier, aimed at individuals with 6+ months of Google Cloud experience. It is a good starting point for developers or administrators and covers the basics of Google Cloud, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the various products and services offered by Google Cloud. This exam also includes the most hands-on skills, such as `gcloud` commands, while remaining multiple choice. Even though it is promoted as an associate rather than a professional-level qualification, there is a substantial amount of material to cover, and the knowledge gap is not as large as it might initially seem.

In this book, you have covered content applicable to the Associate Cloud Engineer exam, Professional Cloud Architect, and Professional Cloud Developer. You also touched on aspects of the Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer in Chapters [12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch12.html#chapter\_12) and [13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch13.html#chapter\_13). The Professional Cloud Architect certification covers the broadest scope of the Google Cloud Platform and is often deemed the most challenging of the exams. All professional-level exams recommend over a year of Google Cloud experience.

If you have diligently worked through this book, I suggest starting with the Associate Cloud Engineer exam, progressing to the Professional Cloud Architect, and thereafter, tailoring your certification journey based on your interests and career aspirations. Although there is no rigid sequence for taking the exams, there is some overlap between them, and the more you undertake, the easier they become. For instance, once you’ve prepared for the Professional Architect exam, the Professional Developer exam does not require a great deal of additional preparation. Following is the full list of certifications available at the time of writing:

Cloud Digital Leader

Focuses on a foundational understanding of Google Cloud’s capabilities and their benefits to organizations

The exams are not easy—that is what makes them valuable—but they are not impossible either. Different people will have different preferences for how to prepare. When I have prepared for exams, I prefer to do a little, often: an hour of reading or watching a video in the morning followed by an hour of hands-on experimentation in the evening. I find that this helps me to retain the information and to build up my knowledge over time. As I get closer to the exam, I do more practice exams; Google provides example questions for each in the exam guide, to get used to the style of questions and identify any gaps in knowledge to work on.

I have a ritual of booking my exam for 10 AM and having Starbucks tea and fruit toast followed by a walk before the exam. I arrive or set up in plenty of time, so I am relaxed. When the exam starts, I recommend reading questions very carefully, as there is often a small detail that makes all the difference to the answer.

Sometimes a difficult question can use up time; in this case, I flag it and move on. I also flag any questions I am not completely sure about and come back later. At the end of the exam, I am usually much more confident about my answers.

Often, there will be a piece of information in one question that may unlock a difficult question earlier on. Most importantly, if you are not sure, make a guess. You will not be penalized for a wrong answer, but you will be penalized for not answering a question.

When you finish and submit your exam, you will get a provisional pass or fail. Google does not give you a score or a breakdown to tell you which questions you got wrong (like AWS, for example). You will get an email a few days later with your final result. You may also receive a code to redeem for a gift from Google (at the time of writing and depending on the exam), which is a nice touch. You can also list your certification in the [Google Cloud Certified Directory](https://oreil.ly/S\_IgP). For example, you can see my profile in the [Directory site](https://oreil.ly/jtzNi).

**TIP**

Resist the temptation to use exam dumps for preparation. These question compilations are often shared in violation of the exam’s confidentiality agreement and tend to be outdated and misleading. The optimal way to prepare is to tap into the vast amount of learning material available, get hands-on experience, and take the official practice exams.

I’ve interviewed candidates who relied on exam dumps, and it’s usually clear: they struggle with basic questions. These exams are meant to gauge your understanding and proficiency with the platform, not rote memorization of facts. Encountering a familiar question in the exam is not as gratifying as being able to answer based on a solid understanding and practical experience.

It is a great feeling when you pass, and if you find the experience useful, there are many other specialties. One thing to note is that certification expires after two years, so if you do many exams at once, you will need to do them all again in two years to stay certified. The exception is that the Cloud Digital Leader and Associate Cloud Engineer certifications are valid for three years. Good luck on your certification journey!
