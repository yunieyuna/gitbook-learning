# 9. Project 5: API And User Interface With API Gateway And Cloud Storage

## Chapter 9. Project 5: API and User Interface with API Gateway and Cloud Storage

In previous chapters, you developed three separate Cloud Run services that collectively constitute the backend for the Skills Mapper application. While the benefit of this arrangement is that each service can be individually maintained and scaled, it has led to a somewhat fragmented system. Navigating this structure currently requires an understanding of which functionality is provided by each distinct service. To recap, these three services are:

Skill service

This service offers suggestions of skills that can be added to the fact service.

Fact service

This is responsible for maintaining the facts necessary for constructing a profile.

Profile service

This updates user profiles as the associated facts evolve.

One significant challenge that needs to be addressed is unauthenticated invocation. Currently, these Cloud Run services expose their APIs to the internet without any authentication, which makes them susceptible to attacks.

To secure the system and streamline its operation, unifying these services under a single, secure API is the subject of this chapter. Additionally, you will deploy a user interface, providing users with a secure and consolidated point of access to the Skills Mapper application’s functionality.

**NOTE**

The code for this chapter is in the [`user-interface` folder of the GitHub repository](https://oreil.ly/sadOe).

## Requirements

Let’s look at the requirements for this final project. The user story for this functionality is shown in [Figure 9-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#p5-postit).

## Solution

This solution mainly introduces some of Google Cloud’s powerful networking services.

### User Interface

So far, you have used Cloud Run to host backend services. You can also use it to host the UI using the same approach as you did for the backend services. You can use Cloud Build to create a container for the UI and deploy it to Cloud Run. However, as the UI is a static website, you will see there is an alternative approach using Cloud Storage and Cloud CDN that will be a little simpler and a lot more cost-effective.

### OpenAPI

To bring together multiple services under a single API, you can define a common API using the OpenAPI specification. You can then use that as the configuration for a Google Cloud API Gateway.

Although OpenAPI is at [version 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) at the time of writing this book, the API Gateway only supports version 2.0, better known as [Swagger 2.0](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/).

The great thing about using an OpenAPI specification is that only the specific endpoints explicitly defined will be exposed via the API Gateway. This has a security benefit; it means that any endpoints not defined in the specification will not be exposed.

For example, with the profile service, there is the endpoint that Google Pub/Sub uses to deliver events to the service. As this endpoint is not defined in the specification, it will not be exposed publicly via the API Gateway, meaning there is no way for an attacker to send a potentially damaging message to the service via that route.

### API Gateway

Google API Gateway is a managed service that is intended to allow you to expose your APIs to the internet. It is a fully managed service that handles the scaling and load balancing of your APIs. It also provides several features such as authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

You will use the API Gateway to expose Skills Mapper’s API to the internet. The API Gateway will be configured from the OpenAPI 2.0 specification you create.

### Global HTTP Load Balancer

In [Chapter 11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#chapter\_11), the API Gateway and the UI will be fronted by a Global HTTP Load Balancer. This is a managed load balancer that is available in all regions. Again, it is a fully managed service. You will be able to provide a custom domain name and generate an SSL certificate to secure the connection.

[Figure 9-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#citadel-design) includes a diagram of the solution.

## Implementation

Once again, let’s roll up our sleeves and move onto the implementation.

### Hosting the UI on Cloud Run

The user interface for Skills Mapper is built using HTML, the [Materialize UI framework](https://materializecss.com/), and JavaScript. As a result, it is a static website.

You can use Cloud Build to create a container for it and deploy it to Cloud Run. However, there is a little configuration to do first. Since you are using Identity Platform for authentication, you need to configure the UI to use the correct client ID. This is done by creating a file called _config.js_ directory.

You need to populate the file with the values of the project ID and the API Key from the Identity Platform configuration.

If you haven’t already set the PROJECT\_ID environment variable, you can do so now:

```
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

Then go to the [Identity Platform configuration page](https://console.cloud.google.com/customer-identity/providers) (see [Figure 9-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#application-setup-details)) for the project and copy the API Key. Click `Application Setup Details` and copy the value of the `apiKey` field.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_0903.png" alt="cdgc 0903" height="636" width="2046"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 9-3. Application setup details**

Add that value to the `API_KEY` environment variable:

```
export API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```

Assuming these are stored in environment variables named `PROJECT_ID` and `API_KEY`, respectively, the file can be created by using the `envsubst` command:

```
envsubst < config.js.template > src/js/config.js
```

This will create a file called _config.js_ in the _src/js_ directory, replacing the placeholders in _config.js.template_ with environment variables. Check that the generated file has values substituted for the placeholders.

#### Creating a Dockerfile

The initial step in deploying the UI as a container is creating a Dockerfile. This file serves as a blueprint for Cloud Build to generate a container for the UI. Within the project directory, you’ll find the Dockerfile named `Dockerfile`, with the web content located in the _src_ directory. The Dockerfile is straightforward as Dockerfiles go and contains the following:

```
FROM nginx                                             
COPY src /usr/share/nginx/html                         
COPY nginx/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf 
```

[![1](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/1.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#co\_project\_5\_\_api\_and\_user\_interface\_with\_\_\_span\_class\_\_keep\_together\_\_api\_gateway\_and\_cloud\_storage\_\_span\_\_CO1-1)

This tells Docker to use the NGINX image as the base image. This is a widely used open source web server.

[![2](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/2.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#co\_project\_5\_\_api\_and\_user\_interface\_with\_\_\_span\_class\_\_keep\_together\_\_api\_gateway\_and\_cloud\_storage\_\_span\_\_CO1-2)

This copies the contents of the _src_ directory into the _/usr/share/nginx/html_ directory in the container, the directory that NGINX uses to serve static content.

[![3](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/3.png)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#co\_project\_5\_\_api\_and\_user\_interface\_with\_\_\_span\_class\_\_keep\_together\_\_api\_gateway\_and\_cloud\_storage\_\_span\_\_CO1-3)

This copies a configuration file _default.conf_ file into the _/etc/nginx/conf.d_ directory in the container.

This is all the configuration that is needed to create a container for the UI.

#### Creating a container with Cloud Build

In previous chapters, you used Cloud Build to create containers for your backend services. You built the containers directly from Go source code using a buildpack in the background. You built Java containers using Jib via a Maven plugin. In this case, you are building a container from a Dockerfile using Cloud Build. The process is not much different from before; Cloud Build will automatically detect that you have a Dockerfile and use the Docker builder rather than looking for Jib or resorting to buildpacks.

First, create an environment variable for the UI service name (e.g., _ui-service_):

```
export UI_SERVICE_NAME=[UI_SERVICE_NAME]
```

To build a container for the UI, run the following command to submit a build to Cloud Build:

```
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${UI_SERVICE_NAME}
```

This will cause Cloud Build to build the container and push it to the Container Registry in the project, but not deploy it to Cloud Run.

### Deploying the UI Container to Cloud Run

As the user interface container does not need any configuration, you do not need to configure any environment variables. It will also run without needing any additional permissions, so you do not need to configure any IAM roles. However, by default, it will use the default service account for the project which has more permissions than is needed. You can create a new service account with the minimum permissions needed and use that instead to follow the security principle of least privilege.

Therefore, create a new service account for the UI with the following command, but do not give it any permissions:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${UI_SERVICE_NAME}-sa \
--display-name "${UI_SERVICE_NAME} service account"
```

You can then deploy the service to Cloud Run using the resulting container and the new service account with this command:

```
gcloud run deploy $UI_SERVICE_NAME \
    --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${UI_SERVICE_NAME} \
    --service-account ${UI_SERVICE_NAME}-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

You can then retrieve the URL of the service with the following command and open it in a browser:

```
open $(gcloud run services describe ${UI_SERVICE_NAME} --format 'value(status.url)')
```

This will open the UI in a browser; however, it will not be able to talk to the API, as the API is not yet deployed. This is one way of hosting the UI, and it may be useful for testing purposes. However, Cloud Run is relatively expensive in this case as you are paying for compute when you don’t need to; the website is static.

If you would like to remove the UI service, use the command:

```
gcloud run services delete ${UI_SERVICE_NAME}
```

### Hosting the UI in a Cloud Storage Bucket

While you can use Cloud Run to host the UI, there is an easier and cheaper alternative; keeping to cloud native principles, you should always be considering simpler and more cost-effective alternatives when available. You can host the UI in a Cloud Storage bucket.

#### Creating a Cloud Storage bucket

Now create a new Cloud Storage bucket with the `gsutil` command. As cloud storage buckets must be globally unique, use the globally unique project ID as a prefix for the name:

```
gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} -c regional -l ${REGION} gs://${PROJECT_ID}-ui
```

The storage class `-c` is `regional` and the `-l` location is the same as the region you are using for the project.

#### Uploading files to the UI storage bucket

Then upload the static files to the new bucket:

```
gsutil -m cp -r ./src/* gs://${PROJECT_ID}-ui
```

Now grant everyone `objectViewer` (yes, everyone) read permissions to the bucket. This is normally a bit scary, as anyone on the internet will be able to read the files. However, since you are hosting a website that is exactly what you want, so run the following command:

```
gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://${PROJECT_ID}-ui
```

#### Configuring the bucket as a website

Finally, enable the `Website` feature on the bucket, using `index.html` as the default web page and `404.html` as the error page:

```
gcloud storage buckets update gs://${PROJECT_ID}-ui \
--web-main-page-suffix=index.html --web-error-page=404.html
```

#### Viewing the website

You will then be able to view the UI at the bucket’s URL:

```
open https://storage.googleapis.com/${PROJECT_ID}-ui/index.html
```

**TIP**

When you use a Google Cloud Storage bucket to host a static website, the files are cached by the Cloud Storage network. This is a good thing, as it means the files are served nearer to your users. However, by default, the cache is set to 1 hour. This means that if you make a change to the website, it may take up to an hour for the change to be visible to users, so it is not practical for rapid development. To avoid this, you can set the cache to 0 seconds, which will cause the files to be reloaded from the bucket every time they are requested. This is not recommended for production use but is useful for development. You can set the cache to 0 seconds with the following command:

```
gsutil setmeta -h "Cache-Control:public, max-age=0" \
gs://${PROJECT_ID}-ui/index.html
```

Another option is using the Cloud Run deployment method for development and the Cloud Storage method for production.

#### How much will this cost?

Cloud Storage offers a highly cost-effective option for hosting static websites because it charges only for storage (which is minimal for static sites) and network egress. Cloud Storage is designed to provide high scalability and availability, making it a great choice for serving high-traffic websites.

If you were to use Cloud Run, you would still be paying for egress costs, but you would also be paying for compute time, which is not needed for a static website.

Although storage costs will be negligible, check [the Cloud Storage pricing site](https://oreil.ly/9DgFU) for current pricing, especially of data egress, as the files are served to your users.

### Configuring the API

A template OpenAPI configuration is in the project directory named _api.yaml.template_. This contains placeholders for project-specific information such as the project ID and the URLs of the Cloud Run services.

First set two environment variables: an API name (e.g., `skillsmapper`) and a domain that you will make the application available at eventually. In my case, I have `skillsmapper.org`:

```
export API_NAME=['API_NAME']
export DOMAIN=['DOMAIN']
```

Then set these environment variables using the following commands:

```
export FACT_SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe ${FACT_SERVICE_NAME} \
--format 'value(status.url)')
export SKILL_SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe ${SKILL_SERVICE_NAME} \
--format 'value(status.url)')
export PROFILE_SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe ${PROFILE_SERVICE_NAME} \
--format 'value(status.url)')
```

To substitute these to generate an _api.yaml_ file for deployment using the `envsubst` command, as you did for the UI configuration, the following command is used:

```
envsubst < api.yaml.template > api.yaml
```

If you open the _api.yaml_ file, you will see several endpoints and other configurations.

The first is the security definition. This is used to configure the authentication for the API using the Identity Platform you set up in [Chapter 7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch07.html#chapter\_07). The configuration is as follows:

```
ssecurityDefinitions:
  firebase:
    authorizationUrl: ""
    flow: "implicit"
    type: "oauth2"
    x-google-issuer: "https://securetoken.google.com/${PROJECT_ID}"
    x-google-jwks_uri:
"https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/metadata/x509/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com"
    x-google-audiences: ${PROJECT_ID}
```

The project ID is substituted for the placeholder `${PROJECT_ID}` in two places that are used to create the JWT that is used for authentication. The `x-google-issuer` is the issuer of the JWT and the `x-google-audiences` is the audience of the JWT. Both of these contain the project ID.

A JWT is created by the Identity Platform and is passed to the API Gateway. The API Gateway will validate the JWT using the `x-google-jwks_uri` value. In a JWT, you will see them in fields like this:

```
"iss": "https://securetoken.google.com/[PROJECT_ID]",
"aud": "[PROJECT_ID]"
```

This is to ensure that the JWT has been issued by the correct project (the `iss` value in the JWT) and is the intended audience (the `aud` value in the JWT) is the same project.

The other Google Cloud–specific configuration in the _api.yaml_ file is the `x-google-backend` configuration. This is used to configure the Cloud Run services that the API Gateway will proxy requests to. For example, the `x-google-backend` configuration for the `GET /skills/autocomplete` endpoint is as follows:

```
  /skills/autocomplete:
    get:
      summary: Autocomplete skills
      operationId: skillsAutocomplete
      description: Returns a list of skill suggestions based on the provided prefix
      x-google-backend:
        address: ${SKILL_SERVICE_URL}/autocomplete
```

For endpoints that take parameters in the path, you need to use the `path_translation: APPEND_PATH_TO_ADDRESS` option. For example, the `GET /api/facts/{id}` endpoint is configured as follows:

```
  /api/facts/{id}:
    get:
...
      x-google-backend:
        address: https://fact-service-<instanceid>.a.run.app
        path_translation: APPEND_PATH_TO_ADDRESS
        jwt_audience: https://fact-service-<instanceid>.a.run.app
```

By default, the API Gateway will pass the `{id}` parameter as a query parameter, and the service will not know how to deal with it, so you need to use the `path_translation` option to ensure the parameter is passed in the path. With this in place, the underlying Cloud Run service will receive the request at the URL `https://fact-service-<instanceid>.a.run.app/api/facts/{id}` with the `{id}` parameter in the path, as expected.

**TIP**

When authenticating with the Cloud Run alone, the JWT of the authenticated user is passed in the `Authorization` header. When using the API Gateway, the `Authorization` header contains a JWT for the service account the API Gateway uses.

This is because the API Gateway is not able to validate the JWT of the user, as it does not have the public key to validate the JWT. The API Gateway will validate the JWT of the service account and then pass the JWT of the user in the `x-forwarded-authorization` header to the Cloud Run service. In the services previously created, the code checks both the `Authorization` and `x-forwarded-authorization` headers for the JWT of the user.

With the API configuration complete, you can deploy it to the API Gateway.

#### Deploying the API to API Gateway

To deploy the API to the API Gateway, you first need to enable the API Gateway API and service control in the project. Service Control is used to control the rate of requests to the API Gateway. You can enable these with the following commands:

```
gcloud services enable apigateway.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable servicecontrol.googleapis.com
```

Now an environment variable for the API Gateway file name:

```
export API_SPEC_FILE=api.yaml
```

At the moment, Cloud Run services can be called directly from the internet, but as previously discussed, this is not good for security. It is much better if calling them can only be done from the API Gateway. To do this, you need to create a service account for the API Gateway:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create "${API_NAME}-gateway-sa" \
    --display-name "Service account to invoke ${API_NAME} services"
```

Then give the service account permission to invoke each of the Cloud Run services in turn with the following commands.

For the fact service:

```
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding $FACT_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "serviceAccount:${API_NAME}-gateway-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

For the skill service:

```
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding $SKILL_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "serviceAccount:${API_NAME}-gateway-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

For the profile service:

```
gcloud run services add-iam-policy-binding $PROFILE_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "serviceAccount:${API_NAME}-gateway-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

With the configuration and service account created, you can now create an API Gateway configuration using the following command:

```
gcloud api-gateway api-configs create ${API_NAME}-config \
    --api=${API_NAME} \
    --openapi-spec=${API_SPEC_FILE} \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
    --backend-auth-service-account=${API_NAME}-gateway-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This uses the API configuration file you generated earlier to create the API Gateway configuration.

You can now create the API Gateway service using the following command:

```
gcloud api-gateway gateways create ${API_NAME}-gateway \
    --api=${API_NAME} \
    --api-config=${API_NAME}-config \
    --location=${REGION} \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID}
```

With the API Gateway service created, you can then access the services via the API Gateway. Retrieve the URL of the API Gateway with the following command:

```
export GATEWAY_URL=$(gcloud api-gateway gateways describe skillsmapper-gateway \
  --location=${REGION} \
  --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
  --format 'value(defaultHostname)')
```

With the API Gateway set up with its own URL, you are now ready for testing.

### Testing the API Gateway

Testing the gateway is as simple as making a request to the gateway URL in preference to the Cloud Run service URL. For example, to test the `GET /skills/autocomplete` endpoint, you could use the following command to call Cloud Run directly:

```
curl -X GET "${SKILL_SERVICE_URL}/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

In the same way, you can now test the API Gateway by calling the same endpoint using the API Gateway URL:

```
curl -X GET "https://${GATEWAY_URL}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

You should see the same response from both calls.

### Disabling Unauthenticated Access to Cloud Run Services

With the API Gateway working, you can now remove unauthenticated access to the Cloud Run services by revoking the `roles/run.invoker` role from `allUsers` from the Cloud Run service.

When you list Cloud Run services with gcloud, it does not show if the service allows unauthenticated access, by default. In the example, code is a small script name `check-services-unauthenticated.sh` that will check that for you:

```
#!/bin/bash
SERVICES=$(gcloud run services list --platform managed --project $PROJECT_ID \
    --region $REGION --format 'value(metadata.name)')

for SERVICE in $SERVICES
do
  echo "Checking service $SERVICE..."
  POLICY=$(gcloud run services get-iam-policy $SERVICE --platform managed \
    --project $PROJECT_ID --region $REGION)
  if echo "$POLICY" | grep -q "allUsers"; then
    echo "$SERVICE is publicly accessible"
  else
    echo "$SERVICE is not publicly accessible"
  fi
done
```

For each service, the script uses gcloud to check the policy applied. You should see currently that all three services are publicly accessible:

```
Checking service fact-service...
fact-service is publicly accessible
Checking service profile-service...
profile-service is publicly accessible
Checking service skill-service...
skill-service is publicly accessible
```

**TIP**

This is a great reason for using the gcloud command-line tool, as it makes it easy to script things like this.

To revoke the `roles/run.invoker` role from `allUsers` for the skill service, you can use the following command:

```
gcloud run services remove-iam-policy-binding $SKILL_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "allUsers"
```

And similarly for the other services:

```
gcloud run services remove-iam-policy-binding $FACT_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "allUsers"
```

```
gcloud run services remove-iam-policy-binding $PROFILE_SERVICE_NAME \
    --role roles/run.invoker \
    --member "allUsers"
```

Run the `check-services-unauthenticated.sh` script again, and you should see that the services are no longer publicly accessible:

```
Checking service fact-service...
fact-service is not publicly accessible
Checking service profile-service...
profile-service is not publicly accessible
Checking service skill-service...
skill-service is not publicly accessible
```

Now, when you try to call the Cloud Run service directly, you will get a 403 Forbidden error as you no longer have permission to call the service anonymously:

```
curl -X GET "${SKILL_SERVICE_URL}/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

However, you can still call the Cloud Run service via the API Gateway:

```
curl -X GET "https://${GATEWAY_URL}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

This is because the API Gateway has the `roles/run.invoker` role to call the Cloud Run service on your behalf. This will also be the case for the other services you added to the API Gateway.

## Summary

You’ve successfully configured and exposed your Cloud Run services in a secure manner via an API Gateway. Furthermore, you’ve leveraged Cloud Storage to host the user interface.

For this project, you used the following services directly:

* OpenAPI is used to design and define the structure of the API, setting clear standards for its behavior.
* Cloud Run is used to host the UI in an NGINX container.
* Cloud Build is used to build the backend services for the UI via a Dockerfile, although you did not use it directly.
* Cloud Storage is used to host the static website content.
* API Gateway allowed you to expose the API to the internet securely and efficiently, enabling robust access to the backend services.

## Coming Next

Now that all components of the Skills Mapper application are deployed, [Part III](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/part03.html#the-facilities) introduces you to the key facilities. These include the laboratory, citadel, factory, and observatory. These facilities are vital for making an application like this manageable and operational.

In [Chapter 11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#chapter\_11), you’ll discover how both the API and UI from this chapter can be fronted by a Global HTTP Load Balancer. This strategy will provide a unified, secure URL for accessing your application, thus enhancing its accessibility and usability.

You’ll also go on to explore how to address the inherent complexity of the system by automating the deployment process further. In addition, you will delve into ways to enhance observability, ensuring that you have clear insight into your application’s performance. Finally, I’ll discuss how to make your system production-ready, focusing on stability, performance, and security. Get ready for making your application robust, resilient, and production-worthy.
