# 11. Citadel

## Chapter 11. Citadel

While the API Gateway is useful for providing a single entry point to your services, it is vulnerable to attack. In this chapter, you will learn how to secure the system from attackers using an HTTP(S) Load Balancer with an SSL/TLS certificate and Cloud Armor. Effectively, you will be building the wall (or more accurately, firewall) of the _citadel_ to protect the application inside.

**NOTE**

The code for this chapter is in the [`citadel` folder of the GitHub repository](https://oreil.ly/wrpIE).

## Securing from Attackers

In [Chapter 9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#chapter\_09), you put services behind an API Gateway. In this chapter, you are going to protect them further.

### Adding a Custom Domain

The Google API Gateway exposes a single URL to access the services behind the API. This is an HTTPS endpoint offering a secure connection. Similarly, putting the UI in a Cloud Storage bucket and exposing it as a website has provided a secure URL. However, it is more useful to put the API and the UI behind the same custom domain name. It is also useful to protect the API Gateway and UI behind a Global Load Balancer and provide your custom HTTPS URL with a valid SSL certificate. As part of Google’s global networking infrastructure, a Global Load Balancer also provides additional benefits such as high availability and scalability, optional caching via a global content delivery network (CDN), and protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

Setting up a Global Load Balancer has many steps, and you will work through them in this chapter.

There are many resources created in the chapter that need a name. Create an environment variable with a prefix (e.g., `skillsmapper`) to help keep names consistent:

```
export PREFIX=skillsmapper
```

### Reserving a Static IP Address

First, you need to reserve a static IP address for the Global Load Balancer. A static IP address remains consistent, so you can point a DNS entry at it and it will always be the same, as opposed to the default ephemeral IP address that can change.

IP addresses are provided by the compute API, so you need to enable that service:

```
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
```

Then you can reserve the address with this command:

```
gcloud compute addresses create ${PREFIX}-ip --global
```

**TIP**

There is a limited supply of IP addresses in the world; while there is no charge for a static IP address used with an HTTP/s Load Balancer, there is an hourly charge for static IP addresses that are unused, so you should delete it when you are finished with it. You can delete the address with this command:

```
gcloud compute addresses delete ${PREFIX}-ip
```

### Creating an A Record to the Static IP Address

You can use the IP address to create an A record in your DNS provider. Get the IP address with the following command:

```
gcloud compute addresses describe ${PREFIX}-ip --global --format 'value(address)'
```

For example, I own the domain `skillsmapper.org` provided by [Google Domains](https://oreil.ly/2dv0D), so I would create an A record for `skillsmapper.org` pointing to this IP address.

### Creating an SSL Certificate

To provide a secure connection to your domain, you need to create an SSL certificate or, more accurately, have Google Cloud create one for you. Create an environment variable for the domain name you created an A record for (e.g., `skillsmapper.org`):

```
export DOMAIN=[DOMAIN]
```

Then use the following command to create the certificate:

```
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create ${PREFIX}-cert \
    --domains=$DOMAIN
```

Creating the certificate can take about an hour, in my experience. You can check the status of the certificate with the following command. Initially, the `domainStatus` will be `PENDING`, but when the status is `ACTIVE`, it is ready to use:

```
gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe ${PREFIX}-cert
```

While you are waiting for the certificate to be issued, you can continue to set up the load balancer.

### Create a Load Balancer

To create a load balancer, there are several components you need to put into place in addition to the Cloud Run services and the API Gateway. [Figure 11-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-start) shows the components you will create.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1101.png" alt="cdgc 1101" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-1. Overview of load balancer components**

Work from left to right, starting from the API Gateway and working toward the forwarding rule. The forwarding rule will take the external IP address as input.

#### Network endpoint group

A network endpoint group (NEG) specifies a group of backend endpoints for a load balancer, as shown in [Figure 11-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-neg).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1102.png" alt="cdgc 1102" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-2. Serverless NEG**

A serverless NEG is a type of NEG that is backed by serverless services like a Cloud Run service. However, as you are using the API Gateway, you need to create a serverless NEG that is backed by the API Gateway. You can create the NEG with the following command:

```
gcloud beta compute network-endpoint-groups create ${PREFIX}-api-gateway-serverless-neg \
    --region=${REGION} \
    --network-endpoint-type=serverless \
    --serverless-deployment-platform=apigateway.googleapis.com \
    --serverless-deployment-resource=${PREFIX}-gateway
```

**NOTE**

At the time of writing, this is still a beta command, as the ability to create a serverless NEG backed by an API Gateway is relatively new; you will therefore need to include `beta` in the command.

#### Backend services

A backend service is typically a service in front of a group of backend instances that receive and process requests from a load balancer, as shown in [Figure 11-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-bg).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1103.png" alt="cdgc 1103" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-3. Backend service**

However, in this case, you are using a serverless backend. You can create the backend service with the following command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services create ${PREFIX}-api-backend \
    --load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL \
    --global
```

Then connect the serverless NEG to the backend service using this command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services add-backend ${PREFIX}-api-backend \
    --global \
    --network-endpoint-group=${PREFIX}-api-gateway-serverless-neg  \
    --network-endpoint-group-region=${REGION}
```

Create a backend bucket using the bucket you created to host the UI in [Chapter 9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#chapter\_09):

```
gcloud compute backend-buckets create ${PREFIX}-ui \
    --gcs-bucket-name=${PROJECT_ID}-ui
```

#### Using the Google content delivery network

At this point, you could also decide to use a content delivery network (CDN) with this; Google Cloud’s built-in CDN can be used. This uses Google’s globally distributed edge points of presence to cache HTTP(S) load-balanced content close to your users. Caching content at the edges of Google’s network provides faster delivery of content to your users while reducing serving costs. There is an extra storage cost as there is a data cache at each edge and network costs to get it there; however, because the UI is only a few small files, this will be negligible.

Enable CDN with this command:

```
gcloud compute backend-buckets update ${PREFIX}-ui --enable-cdn
```

#### URL map

A URL map routes incoming requests to the backend services you just created, as shown in [Figure 11-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-url-map).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1104.png" alt="cdgc 1104" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-4. URL map**

You can create the URL map and link it with the bucket you created to host the UI in [Chapter 9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch09.html#chapter\_09) by default with the following command:

```
gcloud compute url-maps create ${PREFIX}-url-map \
    --default-backend-bucket=${PREFIX}-ui
```

Then add a path matcher to route requests to the API Gateway backend service:

```
gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher ${PREFIX}-url-map \
    --default-backend-bucket=${PREFIX}-ui \
    --path-matcher-name api-path-matcher \
    --path-rules "/api/*=${PREFIX}-api-backend"
```

In this case, any request that starts with `/api/` will be routed to the API Gateway backend service. Anything else, such as the requests for the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, will be routed to the backend bucket by default.

#### Target HTTPS proxy

The URL map is now ready to be used by the target proxy, as shown in [Figure 11-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-proxy). The target proxy is the component that receives the incoming request and routes it to the URL map.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1105.png" alt="cdgc 1105" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-5. Target HTTPS proxy**

Create a target HTTPS proxy to route requests to your URL map, providing the certificate you created earlier to encrypt the connection:

```
gcloud compute target-https-proxies create ${PREFIX}-https-proxy \
    --url-map=${PREFIX}-url-map \
    --ssl-certificates=${PREFIX}-cert
```

#### Forwarding rule

Finally, create a forwarding rule to route requests to the target HTTPS proxy, as shown in [Figure 11-6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch11.html#citadel-fw).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098145071/files/assets/cdgc_1106.png" alt="cdgc 1106" height="113" width="1439"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 11-6. Forwarding rule**

This is the final piece of the puzzle and will allow you to access your API Gateway via the custom domain name over HTTPS:

```
 gcloud compute forwarding-rules create ${PREFIX}-fw \
    --load-balancing-scheme=EXTERNAL \
    --network-tier=PREMIUM \
    --address=${PREFIX}-ip \
    --target-https-proxy=${PREFIX}-https-proxy \
    --global \
    --ports=443
```

This will create an entry point with the external IP address you reserved earlier. You can check the status of the forwarding rule with the following command:

```
gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe ${PREFIX}-fw --global
```

Make sure the `IPAddress` is the same as the IP address you created an A record for at your DNS provider earlier. When that DNS record propagates and your SSL certificate is issued, you will be in a position to test the UI.

### Testing the UI

You can test the UI by visiting the domain name you created an A record for earlier. For example, I created an A record for `skillsmapper.org`, so you can visit [_https://skillsmapper.org_](https://skillsmapper.org/) in my browser and see the UI.

### Testing the API

You can test the API in a similar way to how you tested the API Gateway, by visiting the domain name. For example, here is how you can test the skill lookup:

```
curl -X GET "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

You will receive the same response as you did when you tested the API Gateway.

### Authenticating Real Users with Identity Platform

In [Chapter 7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-development/9781098145071/ch07.html#chapter\_07), you configured Identity Platform using an email and password provider for login. However, managing the passwords of many users can be a headache. Fortunately, Identity Provider also uses an external identity provider such as Google or Facebook. This is a common pattern for applications; it allows users to log in using their existing accounts.

Here is how you can configure Identity Provider to use Google as the identity provider. Go to the [Identity Provider section](https://oreil.ly/nOLci) of the Google Cloud console and make sure you select Providers from the menu on the left. You should see the Email/Password provider you created earlier.

Click “Add a Provider” and select Google from the list of providers.

The page will guide you through setting up the Web SDK configuration, including collecting the Web Client ID and Web Client Secret A from elsewhere in the Google Cloud console.

On the right, you should also see a box labeled Authorized Domains. This is where you can add the domain name you created earlier. For example, I added skillsmapper.org to the list of authorized domains. Without doing this, you will not be able to use the Google login. With the configuration complete, click Save.

Finally, you need to go to visit the OAuth consent page:

```
open "https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=${PROJECT_ID}"
```

Select the External option and complete the following:

* Give the user support email, to an email address you own.
* In authorized domain, add the value of the domain name you created earlier. For example, I added skillsmapper.org to the list of authorized domains.
* Provide the developer contact email, to an email address you own.

For the next two screens, accept the defaults, click “Save and Continue,” and then on the summary tab, click “Back to Dashboard.”

## Testing the UI Authentication

With the Identity Platform set up, you can now test the UI authentication. You can do this by visiting the domain name you created earlier. For example, I created an A record for `skillsmapper.org` so you can visit `https://skillsmapper.org` in my browser and see the UI:

```
open "https://${DOMAIN}"
```

You should see a Skills Mapper page. Click “Sign in with Google” and you should be redirected to the Google login screen. Once you have logged in, you should be redirected back to the UI.

## Evaluation

There are a lot of steps to successfully expose your API to the internet. However, once you have done it, you can reuse the same steps for any other API you create. The steps are also very similar to the steps you would take to expose an API to the internet using a traditional serverless platform such as AWS Lambda.

## How Will This Solution Scale?

You can also use Apache Bench to test the API when accessing the service on Cloud Run directly:

```
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -rk "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

This is a useful test; you may notice that the response time, especially the minimum time, is slower than going to the Cloud Run service directly due to the additional network hops required to access the service. However, the response time is still good, and the benefits of using a custom domain name and SSL certificate are worth the additional latency. You will also see in later chapters how using the load balancer opens up more features.

## Enhancing Defenses with Cloud Armor

While Google’s Global Load Balancer inherently offers a level of protection against DDoS attacks, you can strengthen your defenses further by integrating Google Cloud Armor with HTTP(S) Load Balancing. Cloud Armor allows you to establish IP allow/deny lists and create rules based on Layer 7 parameters, significantly enhancing the protection of your application.

For instance, if a DDoS attack originates from a specific IP address or range of address, Cloud Armor policies enable you to block the attacker(s) right at the network’s edge, preventing the attack from reaching your application.

### Blocking Specific Addresses

Here is a simple demonstration. First, find out your public IP address. I use the [WhatIsMyIPAddress website](https://oreil.ly/u90-g) for this and add this to an environment variable called `MY_IP`:

```
export MY_IP=[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]
```

Then create a security policy:

```
gcloud compute security-policies create "${PREFIX}-security-policy"
```

The rules within this security policy will dictate which traffic is permitted or rejected. You can create rules that allow or deny traffic based on the IP address or range (CIDR block) and IP protocol, among other parameters. The default rule is that all traffic is allowed.

To formulate a rule that denies traffic from a specific IP range, use a command like the following:

```
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
  --security-policy "${PREFIX}-security-policy" \
  --action "deny-403" \
  --src-ip-ranges "${MY_IP}/32"
```

This denies requests from your IP. The `1000` is the priority of the rule, and the lower the number, the higher priority. For example, a rule with a priority `100` will be evaluated before a rule with a priority `1000`.

Before applying this security policy, verify that you can access the SkillsMapper API:

```
curl "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

You should receive the expected response:

```
{"results":["java","java-10","java-11","java-12","java-13",
"java-14","java-15","java-16","java-17","java-18"]}
```

Now apply the policy to the API backend using this command:

```
gcloud compute backend-services update ${PREFIX}-api-backend \
  --security-policy "${PREFIX}-security-policy" \
  --global
```

Wait a minute or two for the policy to propagate. Then attempt to access the API once again:

```
curl "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

You will see your request has been blocked:

```
<!doctype html><meta charset="utf-8">
<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<title>403</title>403 Forbidden
```

To give yourself access again, remove the rule:

```
gcloud compute security-policies rules delete 1000 \
  --security-policy "${PREFIX}-security-policy"
```

This is a trivial example, but it could run the other way around. You could add a default rule to deny all IPs and then add a higher priority rule allowing only your IP. This would mean only you can access the API.

### Rate-Limiting Calls to the API

Another use for Cloud Armor is to rate limit calls to the API.

Here is the Apache Bench command to make 1,000 requests with 10 concurrent connections:

```
ab -n 100 -c 10 -rk "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

To protect the API, you can limit a single IP to 100 requests per minute:

```
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 100 \
    --security-policy "${PREFIX}-security-policy"     \
    --src-ip-ranges="0.0.0.0/0"     \
    --action=throttle                \
    --rate-limit-threshold-count=100 \
    --rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 \
    --conform-action=allow           \
    --exceed-action=deny-429         \
    --enforce-on-key=IP
```

This rule restricts the API call rate to 10 per second. If a user from a single IP address exceeds this limit, they will receive a 429 overlimit error.

Here is a similar command to the `ab` command using a tool called siege, rather appropriate for attacking the citadel:

```
siege -c 10 -r 100 -v "https://${DOMAIN}/api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java"
```

Siege will make 100 requests with 10 concurrent connections and list the response codes. You will see after a while that the requests are being rejected with a 429 overlimit error as the throttle limit is exceeded:

```
HTTP/1.1 200     0.48 secs:     110 bytes ==> GET  /api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java
HTTP/1.1 200     0.47 secs:     110 bytes ==> GET  /api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java
HTTP/1.1 429     0.46 secs:     142 bytes ==> GET  /api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java
HTTP/1.1 429     0.46 secs:     142 bytes ==> GET  /api/skills/autocomplete?prefix=java
```

You can extend this to ban any IP that surpasses the limit excessively. For example, exceeding the limit of 100 requests in 60 seconds would result in a five-minute ban and a 403 Forbidden error would be returned instead of a 429 overlimit error:

```
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 100 \
    --security-policy "${PREFIX}-security-policy" \
    --src-ip-ranges="0.0.0.0/0" \
    --action=rate-based-ban \
    --ban-duration-sec=300 \
    --rate-limit-threshold-count=100 \
    --rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60 \
    --conform-action=allow \
    --exceed-action=deny-403 \
    --enforce-on-key=IP
```

### Extending Cloud Armor Further

Though it’s a step toward securing against DDoS attacks at a reasonable cost, Cloud Armor also offers a premium service known as [Google Cloud Armor Managed Protection Plus](https://oreil.ly/wX6bV).

This service provides threat intelligence features, like automatically blocking a managed list of known malicious IP addresses and Adaptive Protection, which uses AI models to detect and block DDoS attacks. While this solution costs several thousand dollars monthly and necessitates a minimum commitment of one year, it is an example of a significant enhancement in application security that is available.

### How Much Will This Solution Cost?

There are several charges associated with this solution. The main ones are:

* Forwarding rule for the Load Balancer. This will cost $0.025 per hour, which adds up to $18.00 per month.
* Data processed by the Load Balancer. This will cost $0.01 per GB.
* Cloud Armor policy with two rules enforcing a rate limit will cost $7 per month.

Adding these features is not free, but it is still very reasonable.

## Summary

You have created a citadel with strong walls to protect the application using a Global Load Balancer with the default protection it provides and specific protection with Cloud Armor to protect against attack. As you can see, managing the system is becoming more complex as you add more layers. It is not trivial to set up everything or to tear everything down, and debugging any problems will get difficult quickly.

In this chapter, you used the following services directly:

* Global HTTP Load Balancer is used to route requests to the API Gateway from a domain name and provide an encrypted connection.
* Identity Platform is used to authenticate users using their Google account.
* Cloud Armor is used to protect the application from outside attacks and rate-limit individual IP addresses.

In the following chapters, you will look at how you can address the complexity you now have by automating the deployment further, providing observability and making the system more suitable for production.
