# 3. Installing Docker

## Chapter 3. Installing Docker

We’re now at the point where you hopefully understand roughly what Docker is and what it isn’t, and it’s time for some hands-on work. Let’s get Docker installed so we can work with it. The steps required to install Docker vary depending on the platform you use for development and the Linux distribution you use to host your applications in production.

In this chapter, we discuss the steps required to get a fully working Docker development environment set up on most modern desktop operating systems. First, we’ll install the Docker client on your native development platform, and then we’ll get a Docker server running on Linux. Finally, we’ll test out the installation to make sure it works as expected.

Although the Docker client can run on Windows and macOS to control a Docker server, Linux containers can only be built and launched on a Linux system. Therefore, non-Linux systems will require a virtual machine or remote server to host the Linux-based Docker server. Docker Community Edition, Docker Desktop, and Vagrant, which are all discussed later in this chapter, provide some approaches to address this issue. It is also possible to run Windows containers natively on Windows systems, and we will specifically discuss this in [“Windows Containers”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch05.html#windows\_containers), but most of the book’s focus will be on Linux containers.

**NOTE**

The Docker ecosystem is changing very rapidly as the technology evolves to become more robust and solve a broader range of problems. Some features discussed in this book and elsewhere may become deprecated. To see what has been tagged for deprecation and eventual removal, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated).

**TIP**

We assume that you are using a traditional Unix shell in most of the code examples in the book. You can use PowerShell, but be aware that some commands will need adjusting to work in that environment.

If you are in an environment that requires you to use a proxy, make sure that it is [properly configured for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy).

## Docker Client

The Docker client natively supports 64-bit versions of Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The majority of popular Linux distributions can trace their origins to either Debian or Red Hat. Debian systems utilize the deb package format and [Advanced Package Tool (`apt`)](https://wiki.debian.org/AptCLI) to install most prepackaged software. On the other hand, Red Hat systems rely on RPM Package Manager (`rpm`) files and [Yellowdog Updater, Modified (`yum`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum\_\(software\)), or [Dandified `yum` (`dnf`)](https://goo.gl/TdkGRS) to install similar software packages. Alpine Linux, which is often used in environments that require a very small Linux footprint, relies on the [Alpine Package Keeper (`apk`)](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Package\_management) to manage software packages.

On macOS and Microsoft Windows, native GUI installers provide the easiest method to install and maintain prepackaged software. [Homebrew for macOS](https://brew.sh/) and [Chocolatey for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/) are also very popular options among technical users.

**WARNING**

We will be discussing a few approaches to installing Docker in this section. Make sure that you pick the first one in this list that best matches your needs. Installing more than one may cause problems if you are not well versed in how to switch between them properly.

Choose one of these: Docker Desktop, Docker Community Edition, OS package manager, or Vagrant.

You can always find the most recent [installation documentation ](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)on the Docker website.

### Linux

It is strongly recommended that you run Docker on a modern release of your preferred Linux distribution. It is possible to run Docker on some older releases, but stability may be a significant issue. Generally, a 3.8 or later kernel is required, and we advise you to use the newest stable version of your chosen distribution. The following directions assume you are using a recent stable release of the Ubuntu or Fedora Linux distributions.

**TIP**

Although we are not covering it here, [Docker Desktop for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install) has been released and can be used on Linux if you would prefer running the Docker daemon on a local virtual machine instead of directly on your system.

#### Ubuntu Linux 22.04 (64-bit)

Let’s take a look at the steps required to install Docker on the 64-bit version of Ubuntu Linux 22.04.

**NOTE**

For up-to-date instructions or coverage of other versions of Ubuntu, see the [Docker Community Edition for Ubuntu](https://dockr.ly/2NwNbuw).

These first two commands will ensure that you aren’t running older versions of Docker. The packages have been renamed a few times, so you’ll need to specify several possibilities here:

```
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker.io containerd runc
$ sudo apt-get remove docker-engine
```

**NOTE**

It is safe to ignore `apt-get` errors that say “Unable to locate package” or “Package is not installed.”

Next, you will need to add the required software dependencies and _apt_ repository for Docker Community Edition. This lets us fetch and install packages for Docker and validate that they are signed:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg |\
    sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
$ echo \
    "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
    signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    $(lsb_release -cs) stable" |\
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Now that you have the repository set up, run the following commands to install Docker:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install \
    docker-ce \
    docker-ce-cli \
    containerd.io \
    docker-compose-plugin
```

Assuming you don’t get any error messages, you now have Docker installed!

#### Fedora Linux 36 (64-bit)

Now let’s take a look at the steps needed to install Docker on the 64-bit version of Fedora Linux 36.

**NOTE**

For up-to-date instructions or coverage of other versions of Fedora, see the [Docker Community Edition for Fedora](https://dockr.ly/2NwNdTa).

This first command will ensure that you aren’t running older versions of Docker. As on Ubuntu systems, the package has been renamed a few times, so you’ll need to specify several possibilities here:

```
$ sudo dnf remove -y \
    docker \
    docker-client \
    docker-client-latest \
    docker-common \
    docker-latest \
    docker-latest-logrotate \
    docker-logrotate \
    docker-selinux \
    docker-engine-selinux \
    docker-engine
```

Next, you will need to add the required software dependencies and _dnf_ repository for Docker Community Edition:

```
$ sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
$ sudo dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo
```

Now you can install the current version of Docker Community Edition:

```
$ sudo dnf install -y \
    docker-ce \
    docker-ce-cli \
    containerd.io \
    docker-compose-plugin
```

### macOS, Mac OS X

To install Docker on macOS, you should use the official Docker Desktop installer.

#### GUI installer

Download the [latest Docker Desktop for Mac installer](https://dockr.ly/2wyTpCO), and then double-click on the downloaded program icon. Follow all of the installer’s prompts until the installation is finished. Docker Desktop for macOS relies on the [xhyve](https://github.com/machyve/xhyve) project and Apple’s [Hypervisor framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/hypervisor) to provide a native lightweight virtualization layer for the Linux server component, which is required to launch Linux virtual machines that can build Docker images and run containers.

#### Homebrew installation

You can also install the Docker CLI tools using the popular [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) package management system for macOS. If you take this approach, you should consider installing Vagrant for creating and managing your Linux VM. We’ll discuss that shortly in [“Non-Linux VM-Based Server”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#vm\_server).

### Microsoft Windows 11

Here are the steps required to install Docker Desktop on Windows 11.

**TIP**

It is highly recommended that you set up the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) _before_ installing Docker Desktop, and then select any available options in the Docker Desktop installer to enable and default to WSL2.

Docker Desktop for Windows can leverage [Hyper-V](https://oreil.ly/vt6-o)[1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#idm46803156871040) to provide a native virtualization layer for the Linux server components, but [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) should provide you with the smoothest experience when working with Linux containers.

Download the [latest Docker Desktop for Windows installer](https://dockr.ly/2C0n7H0), and then double-click on the downloaded program icon. Follow all of the installer prompts until the installation is finished.

## ENABLING LINUX CONTAINER MODE FOR WINDOWS

By default, your Docker Desktop installation on Windows should be set up for Linux containers, but if you ever get a message that says something like “no matching manifest for windows/amd64,” then Docker Desktop is likely configured for Windows containers.

Linux containers are still the most common type of Linux container, and this book requires Linux container support. You can easily change your Windows setup by right-clicking on the Docker icon in the Windows taskbar and selecting “Switch to Linux containers…,” as shown in Figures [3-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#figure3-1) and [3-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#figure3-2).

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098131814/files/assets/dur3_0301.png" alt="Switch to Linux containers" height="605" width="600"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 3-1. Switch to Linux containers**

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098131814/files/assets/dur3_0302.png" alt="Switch to Linux containers confirmation" height="216" width="600"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 3-2. Switch to Linux containers confirmation**

You can easily switch back and forth if you need to use both Linux and Windows containers.

#### Chocolatey installation

You can also install the Docker CLI tools using the popular [Chocolatey](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup) package management system for Windows. If you take this approach, you should consider installing Vagrant for creating and managing your Linux VM. We’ll discuss that shortly in [“Non-Linux VM-Based Server”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#vm\_server).

**NOTE**

The [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) has installation directions for additional environments online.

## Docker Server

The Docker server is a separate binary from the client and is used to manage most of the work for which Docker is typically used. Next we will explore the most common ways to manage the Docker server.

**NOTE**

Docker Desktop and Docker Community Edition already set up the server for you, so if you took that route, you do not need to do anything else besides ensuring that the server (`dockerd`) is running. On Windows and macOS, this typically just means starting the Docker application. On Linux, you may need to run the following `systemctl` commands to start the server.

### systemd-Based Linux

Current Fedora and Ubuntu releases use [`systemd`](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) to manage processes on the system. Because you have already installed Docker, you can ensure that the server starts every time you boot the system by typing this:

```
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
```

This tells `systemd` to enable the `docker` service and start it when the system boots or switches into the default run level. To start the Docker server, type the following:

```
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Non-Linux VM-Based Server

If you are using Microsoft Windows or macOS in your Docker workflow, you will need a VM so that you can set up a Docker server for testing. Docker Desktop is convenient because it sets up this VM for you using the native virtualization technology on these platforms. If you are running an older version of Windows or cannot use Docker Desktop for other reasons, you should investigate [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to help you create and manage your Docker server Linux VM.

In addition to using Vagrant, you can also use other virtualization tools, like [Lima on macOS](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) or any standard hypervisor, to set up a local Docker server, depending on your preferences and needs.

#### Vagrant

Vagrant provides support for multiple hypervisors and can often be leveraged to mimic even the most complex environments.

A common use case for leveraging Vagrant during Docker development is to support testing on images that match your production environment. Vagrant supports everything from broad distributions like [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) to finely focused atomic host distributions like [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos).

You can easily install Vagrant on most platforms by [downloading a self-contained package](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

**WARNING**

This Vagrant example is not secure and is not intended to be a recommendation. Instead, it is simply a demonstration of the basic requirements needed to set up a _remote_ Docker server VM and make use of it. Securing the server is of critical importance.

Using Docker Desktop for development is often a better option, when possible.

You will need to have a hypervisor, like one of the following, fully installed on your system:

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * Freely available
  * Supports multiplatforms on most architectures
* [VMware Workstation Pro/Fusion](https://oreil.ly/4uNsR)[2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#idm46803156697792)
  * Commercial software
  * Supports multiplatforms on most architectures
* [HyperV](https://oreil.ly/agPTI)[3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#idm46803156692368)
  * Commercial software
  * Supports Windows on most architectures
* [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/)
  * Freely available
  * Supports Linux on most architectures

By default, Vagrant assumes that you are using the VirtualBox hypervisor, but you can change it by using the [`--provider` flag](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vagrant/getting-started-providers) when using the `vagrant` command.

In the following example, you will create a Ubuntu-based Docker host running the Docker daemon. Then you will create a host directory with a name similar to _docker-host_ and move into that directory:

```
$ mkdir docker-host
$ cd docker-host
```

In order to use Vagrant, you need to [find a Vagrant Box (VM image)](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search) that is compatible with your provisioner and architecture. In this example, we will use a Vagrant Box for the Virtual Box hypervisor.

**NOTE**

Virtual Box only works on Intel/AMD x86(64) systems, and the Vagrant Box we are using is specifically built for AMD64 systems.

Go ahead and create a new file called _Vagrantfile_ with the following contents in it:

```
puts (<<-EOT)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  [WARNING] This exposes an unencrypted Docker TCP port on the VM!!

  This is NOT secure and may expose your system to significant risk
  if left running and exposed to the broader network.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------

EOT

$script = <<-SCRIPT
echo \'{"hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2375", "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]}\' | \
sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
echo -e \"[Service]\nExecStart=\nExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd\" | \
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
SCRIPT

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

  # Pick a compatible Vagrant Box
  config.vm.box = 'bento/ubuntu-20.04'

  # Install Docker if it is not already on the VM image
  config.vm.provision :docker

  # Configure Docker to listen on an unencrypted local port
  config.vm.provision "shell",
    inline: $script,
    run: "always"

  # Port-forward the Docker port to
  # 12375 (or another open port) on our host machine
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port",
    guest: 2375,
    host: 12375,
    protocol: "tcp",
    auto_correct: true

end
```

You can retrieve a complete copy of this file by running this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bluewhalebook/\
docker-up-and-running-3rd-edition.git --config core.autocrlf=input
$ cd docker-up-and-running-3rd-edition/chapter_03/vagrant
$ ls Vagrantfile
```

**NOTE**

You may need to remove the “\” in the `git clone` command and reassemble the URL into a single line. It is there because the command is too long for the standard printed page, and this should work in a standard Unix shell as long as there are no leading or trailing spaces in either line.

Ensure that you are in the directory with the _Vagrantfile_, and then run the following command to start the Vagrant VM.

**WARNING**

This setup is provided as a simple example. It is not secure and should not be left running without ensuring that the server cannot be accessed from the broader network.

Docker maintains [documentation on how to secure your Docker endpoint with SSH or TLS client certificates](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access) and provides some additional information about the [attack surface of the Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface).

```
$ vagrant up
…

    default: [Service]
    default: ExecStart=
    default: ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd
```

**TIP**

On macOS, you may see an error like this:

`VBoxManage: error: Details: code NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005), component MachineWrap, interface IMachine`

This is due to the security features in macOS. A quick search should lead you to an [online post that describes the fix](https://scriptcrunch.com/solved-vboxmanage-error-component-machinewrap).

Once the VM is running, you should be able to connect to the Docker server by running the following command and telling the Docker client where it should connect to with the `-H` argument:

```
$ docker -H 127.0.0.1:12375 version
Client:
 Cloud integration: v1.0.24
 Version:           20.10.14
 API version:       1.41
…

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          20.10.17
  API version:      1.41 (minimum version 1.12)
…
```

The output will provide you with version information about the various components that make up the Docker client and server.

Passing in the IP address and port every time you want to run a Docker command is not ideal, but luckily Docker can be set up to know about multiple Docker servers by using the `docker context` command. To start, let’s check and see what context is currently in use. Take note of the entry that has an asterisk (\*) next to it, which designates the current context:

```
$ docker context list
NAME       TYPE … DOCKER ENDPOINT             …
default *  moby … unix:///var/run/docker.sock …
…
```

You can create a new context for the Vagrant VM and then make it active by running the following sequence of commands:

```
$ docker context create vagrant --docker host=tcp://127.0.0.1:12375
vagrant
Successfully created context "vagrant"

$ docker context use vagrant
vagrant
```

If you re-list all the contexts now, you should see something like this:

```
$ docker context list
NAME       TYPE … DOCKER ENDPOINT             …
default    moby … unix:///var/run/docker.sock …
vagrant *  moby … tcp://127.0.0.1:12375       …
…
```

With your current context set to `vagrant`, running `docker version` without the additional `-H` argument will still connect to the correct Docker server and return the same information as before.

To connect to a shell on the Vagrant-based VM, you can run the following:

```
$ vagrant ssh
…
Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-91-generic x86_64)
…
vagrant@vagrant:~$ exit
```

Until you have time to secure this setup, it is best to go ahead and shut down the VM and set your context back to its original state:

```
$ vagrant halt
…
==> default: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM…

$ docker version
Cannot connect to … daemon at tcp://127.0.0.1:12375. Is the … daemon running?

$ docker context use default
default
```

**TIP**

If you are using macOS, you might want to take a look at [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), which makes it very easy to spin up and manage a flexible Docker or Kubernetes VM.

## Testing the Setup

Once you have a working client and server set up, you are ready to test that everything is working. You should be able to run any one of the following commands on your local system to tell the Docker daemon to download the latest official container for that distribution and then launch it with a running Unix shell process.

This step is important to ensure that all the pieces are properly installed and communicating with one another as expected. It shows off one of the features of Docker: we can run containers based on any Linux distribution we like. In the next few steps, we’ll run Linux containers based on Ubuntu, Fedora, and Alpine Linux. You don’t need to run them all to prove that this works; running one of them will suffice.

**NOTE**

If you are using the Docker client on a Linux system, you may need to prepend each `docker` command with `sudo` since the _root_ user may be the only one with Docker access, by default.

Most Docker installs create a `docker` group that can be used to manage who has access to the `dockerd` Unix socket. You can add your user to that group so that you no longer need to use the [`sudo` command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sudo.8.html).

### Ubuntu

Let’s try launching a container using the latest Ubuntu Linux base image:

```
$ docker container run --rm -ti docker.io/ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

root@aa9b72ae1fea:/#
```

**TIP**

Using `docker container run` is functionally the same as using `docker run`.

### Fedora

In this example, we launch a container using the latest Fedora Linux base image:

```
$ docker container run --rm -ti docker.io/fedora:latest /bin/bash

[root@5c97201e827b /]# exit
```

### Alpine Linux

And then finally, we can test launching a container using the latest Alpine Linux base image:

```
$ docker container run --rm -ti docker.io/alpine:latest /bin/sh

/ # exit
```

**NOTE**

`docker.io/ubuntu:latest`, `docker.io/fedora:latest`, and `docker.io/alpine:latest` all represent a Docker image repository, followed by an image name and an image tag.

## Exploring the Docker Server

Although the Docker server is often installed, enabled, and run automatically, it’s useful to see that [running the Docker daemon manually on a Linux system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd) can be as simple as typing something like this:

```
$ sudo dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock \
  --config-file /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

**NOTE**

This section assumes that you are on the actual Linux server or VM that is running the Docker daemon. If you are using Docker Desktop on Windows or Mac, you won’t be able to easily interact with the `dockerd` executable, as it is intentionally hidden from the end user, but we’ll show you a trick in just a moment.

This command starts the Docker daemon, creates and listens to a Unix domain socket (`-H unix:///var/run/docker.sock`), and reads in the rest of the configuration from _/etc/docker/daemon.json_. You’re not likely to have to start the Docker server yourself, but that’s what’s going on behind the scenes. On non-Linux systems, you will typically have a Linux-based VM that hosts the Docker server. Docker Desktop sets up this VM for you in the background.

**NOTE**

If you already have Docker running, executing the daemon again will fail because it can’t use the same network port twice.

In most cases, it is very easy to SSH into your new Docker server and take a look around, but the seamless experience of Docker Desktop on a non-Linux system means it is often not apparent that Docker Desktop is leveraging a local VM on which to run the Docker daemon. Because the Docker Desktop VM is designed to be very small and very stable, it does not run an SSH daemon and is, therefore, a bit tricky to access.

If you are curious or just ever have a need to access the underlying VM, you can do it, but it requires a little advanced knowledge. We will talk about the command `nsenter` in much more detail in [“nsenter”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch11.html#nsenter), but for now, if you would like to see the VM (or underlying host), you can run these commands:

```
$ docker container run --rm -it --privileged --pid=host debian \
  nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh

/ # cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Docker Desktop"

/ # ps | grep dockerd
 1540 root      1:05 /usr/local/bin/dockerd
                      --containerd /var/run/desktop-containerd/containerd.sock
                      --pidfile /run/desktop/docker.pid
                      --swarm-default-advertise-addr=eth0
                      --host-gateway-ip 192.168.65.2

/ # exit
```

This command uses a privileged Debian container that contains the `nsenter` command to manipulate the Linux kernel namespaces so that we can navigate the filesystem of the underlying VM or host.

**WARNING**

This container is privileged to allow us to navigate the underlying host, but you should not get into the habit of using privileged containers when adding individual capabilities or system call privileges will suffice. We discuss this more in [“Security”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch11.html#security).

If you can use a Docker server endpoint, this command will give you access to the underlying host.

The Docker daemon configuration is typically stored in _/etc/docker/daemon.json_, but you may notice that it exists somewhere like _/containers/services/docker/rootfs/etc/docker/daemon.json_ in the Docker Desktop VM. Docker uses reasonable defaults for all its settings, so this file may be very small or even completely absent. If you are using Docker Desktop, you can edit this file by clicking on the Docker icon and selecting Preferences… → Docker Engine, as shown in [Figure 3-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-up/9781098131814/ch03.html#figure3-3).

## Wrap-Up

Now that you have a running Docker setup, you can start to look at more than the basic mechanics of getting it installed. In the next chapter, you’ll explore how to build and manage Docker images, which provide the basis for every container you will ever launch with Docker.

**TIP**

In the rest of the book, when you see `docker` on the command line, assume you will need to have the correct configuration in place either as a Docker context, environment variables, or via the `-H` command-line flag to tell the `docker` client how to connect to the `dockerd` server process.
