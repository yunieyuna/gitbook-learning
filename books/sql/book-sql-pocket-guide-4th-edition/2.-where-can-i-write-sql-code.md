# 2. Where Can I Write SQL Code?

## Chapter 2. Where Can I Write SQL Code?

This chapter covers three places where you can write SQL code:

RDBMS Software

To write SQL code, you first have to download an RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite. The nuances of each RDBMS are highlighted in [“RDBMS Software”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#rdbms\_software).

Database Tools

Once you’ve downloaded an RDBMS, the most basic way to write SQL code is through a _terminal window_, which is a text-only black-and-white screen. Most people prefer to use a _database tool_ instead, which is a more user-friendly application that connects to an RDBMS behind the scenes.

A database tool will have a _graphical user interface_ (GUI), which allows users to visually explore tables and more easily edit SQL code. [“Database Tools”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#database\_tools) goes through how to connect a database tool to an RDBMS.

Other Programming Languages

SQL can be written within many other programming languages. This chapter focuses on two in particular: Python and R. They are popular open source programming languages used by data scientists and data analysts, who often need to write SQL code as well.

Instead of switching back and forth between Python/R and an RDBMS, you can connect Python/R directly to an RDBMS and write SQL code within Python/R. [“Other Programming Languages”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#other\_programming\_languages) walks through how to do so step by step.

## RDBMS Software

This section includes installation instructions and short code snippets for the five RDBMSs that are covered in this book.

### Which RDBMS to Choose?

If you are working at a company that is already using an RDBMS, you will need to use the same one.

If you are working on a personal project, you will need to decide which RDBMS to use. You can refer back to [Table 1-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch01.html#rdbms\_comparison\_table) in [Chapter 1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch01.html#sql\_crash\_course) to review the details of some popular ones.

**QUICK START WITH SQLITE**

Want to start writing SQL code as soon as possible? SQLite is the fastest RDBMS to set up.

Compared to the other RDBMSs in this book, it’s less secure and can’t handle multiple users, but it provides basic SQL functionality in a compact package.

Because of this, I’ve moved SQLite up to the front of each section of this chapter since its setup is generally more straightforward than the others.

### What Is a Terminal Window?

I’ll often refer to a terminal window in this chapter because once you’ve downloaded an RDBMS, it’s the most basic way to interact with the RDBMS.

A _terminal window_ is an application on your computer that typically has a black background and only allows text inputs. The application name varies by operating system:

* On Windows, use the Command Prompt application.
* On macOS and Linux, use the Terminal application.

Once you open up a terminal window, you’ll see a _command prompt_, which looks like a `>` followed by a flashing box. This means that it’s ready to take in text commands from the user.

**TIP**

The next sections include links to download RDBMS installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

On macOS and Linux, an alternative to downloading an installer is to use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager instead. Once you install Homebrew, you can run simple `brew install` commands from the Terminal to do all of the RDBMS installations.

### SQLite

SQLite is free and the most lightweight install, meaning that it doesn’t take up much space on your computer and is extremely quick to set up. For Windows and Linux, SQLite Tools can be downloaded from the [SQLite Download Page](https://oreil.ly/gNagl). macOS comes with SQLite already installed.

**TIP**

The simplest way to start using SQLite is to open a [terminal window](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#what\_is\_a\_terminal\_window) and type **`sqlite3`**. With this approach, however, everything is done in memory, meaning that changes will not be saved once you close SQLite.

```
> sqlite3
```

If you want your changes to be saved, you should connect to a database upon opening with the following syntax:

```
> sqlite3 my_new_db.db
```

The command prompt for SQLite looks like this:

```
sqlite>
```

Some quick code to test things out:

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE test (id int, num int);
sqlite> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 100), (2, 200);
sqlite> SELECT * FROM test LIMIT 1;

1|100
```

To show databases, show tables, and exit:

```
sqlite> .databases
sqlite> .tables
sqlite> .quit
```

**TIP**

If you want to display column names in your output, type:

```
sqlite> .headers on
```

To hide them again, type:

```
sqlite> .headers off
```

### MySQL

MySQL is free, even though it is now owned by Oracle. MySQL Community Server can be downloaded from the [MySQL Community Downloads](https://oreil.ly/Bkv0m) page. On macOS and Linux, alternatively, you can do the installation with Homebrew by typing **`brew install mysql`** in the Terminal.

The command prompt for MySQL looks like this:

```
mysql>
```

Some quick code to test things out:

```
mysql> CREATE TABLE test (id int, num int);
mysql> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 100), (2, 200);
mysql> SELECT * FROM test LIMIT 1;

+------+------+
| id   | num  |
+------+------+
|    1 |  100 |
+------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

To show databases, switch databases, show tables, and exit:

```
mysql> show databases;
mysql> connect another_db;
mysql> show tables;
mysql> quit
```

### Oracle

Oracle is proprietary and works on Windows and Linux machines. Oracle Database Express Edition, the free edition, can be downloaded from the [Oracle Database XE Downloads page](https://oreil.ly/FGoXw).

The command prompt for Oracle looks like this:

```
SQL>
```

Some quick code to test things out:

```
SQL> CREATE TABLE test (id int, num int);
SQL> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 100);
SQL> INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, 200);
SQL> SELECT * FROM test WHERE ROWNUM <=1;

        ID        NUM
---------- ----------
         1        100
```

To show databases, show all tables (including system tables), show user-created tables, and exit:

```
SQL> SELECT * FROM global_name;
SQL> SELECT table_name FROM all_tables;
SQL> SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
SQL> quit
```

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is free and often used alongside other open source technologies. PostgreSQL can be downloaded from the [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://oreil.ly/8MyzC) page. On macOS and Linux, alternatively, you can do the installation with Homebrew by typing **`brew install postgresql`** in the Terminal.

The command prompt for PostgreSQL looks like this:

```
postgres=#
```

Some quick code to test things out:

```
postgres=# CREATE TABLE test (id int, num int);
postgres=# INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 100),
  (2, 200);
postgres=# SELECT * FROM test LIMIT 1;

 id | num
----+-----
  1 | 100
(1 row)
```

To show databases, switch databases, show tables, and exit:

```
postgres=# \l
postgres=# \c another_db
postgres=# \d
postgres=# \q
```

**TIP**

If you ever see `postgres-#`, that means that you’ve forgotten a semicolon at the end of a SQL statement. Type `;` and you should see `postgres=#` again.

If you ever see `:`, that means you’ve been automatically switched to the vi text editor, and you can exit by typing `q`.

### SQL Server

SQL Server is proprietary (owned by Microsoft) and works on Windows and Linux machines. It can also be installed via Docker. SQL Server Express, the free edition, can be downloaded from the [Microsoft SQL Server Downloads](https://oreil.ly/zAxh9) page.

The command prompt for SQL Server looks like this:

```
1>
```

Some quick code to test things out:

```
1> CREATE TABLE test (id int, num int);
2> INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 100), (2, 200);
3> go
1> SELECT TOP 1 * FROM test;
2> go
```

```
id         num
---------- ----------
         1        100

(1 row affected)
```

To show databases, switch databases, show tables, and exit:

```
1> SELECT name FROM master.sys.databases;
2> go
1> USE another_db;
2> go
1> SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;
2> go
1> quit
```

**NOTE**

In _SQL Server_, SQL code is not executed until you type the `go` command on a new line.

## Database Tools

Instead of working with an RDBMS directly, most people will use a database tool to interact with a database. A database tool comes with a nice graphical user interface that allows you to point, click, and write SQL code in a user-friendly setting.

Behind the scenes, a database tool uses a _database driver_, which is software that helps the database tool talk to a database. [Figure 2-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#terminal\_vs\_database\_tool) shows the visual differences between accessing a database directly through a terminal window versus indirectly through a database tool.

<figure><img src="https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492090397/files/assets/spg4_0201.png" alt="spg4 0201" height="540" width="600"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Figure 2-1. Accessing an RDBMS through a terminal window versus a database tool**

There are a number of database tools available. Some work specifically with a single RDBMS, and others work with multiple RDBMSs. [Table 2-1](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#database\_tool\_comparison\_table) lists each RDBMS along with one of the most popular database tools for that particular RDBMS. All of the database tools in the table are free to download and use, and there are many other proprietary ones out there as well.

| RDBMS      | Database Tool                | Details                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | DB Browser for SQLite        | <p>- Different developer than SQLite</p><p>- One of many tool options for SQLite</p>                          |
| MySQL      | MySQL Workbench              | - Same developer as MySQL                                                                                     |
| Oracle     | Oracle SQL Developer         | - Developed by Oracle                                                                                         |
| PostgreSQL | pgAdmin                      | <p>- Different contributors than PostgreSQL</p><p>- Included with the PostgreSQL install</p>                  |
| SQL Server | SQL Server Management Studio | - Developed by Microsoft                                                                                      |
| Multiple   | DBeaver                      | - One of many tool options for connecting to a variety of RDBMSs (including any of the preceding five listed) |

### Connect a Database Tool to a Database

When opening up a database tool, the first step is to connect to a database. This can be done in several ways:

Option 1: Create a New Database

You can create a brand-new database by writing a `CREATE` statement:

```
CREATE DATABASE my_new_db;
```

Afterward, you can create tables to populate the database. More details can be found in [“Creating Tables”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch05.html#creating\_tables) in [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch05.html#creating\_updating\_and\_deleting).

Option 2: Open Up a Database File

You may have downloaded or been given a file with a _.db_ extension:

```
my_new_db.db
```

This _.db_ file will already contain a number of tables. You can simply open it up within a database tool and start interacting with the database.

Option 3: Connect to an Existing Database

You may want to work with a database that is either on your computer or on a _remote server_, meaning that the data is on a computer located elsewhere. This is extremely common these days with _cloud computing_, where people use servers owned by companies like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft.

**DATABASE CONNECTION FIELDS**

To connect to a database, you’ll need to fill out the following fields within a database tool:

Host

Where the database is located.

* If the database is on your computer, then this should be _localhost_ or _127.0.0.1_.
* If the database is on a remote server, then this should be the IP address of that computer example: _123.45.678.90_.

Port

How to connect to the RDBMS.

There should already be a default port number in this field, and you shouldn’t change it. It will be different for each RDBMS.

* MySQL: _3306_
* Oracle: _1521_
* PostgreSQL: _5432_
* SQL Server: _1433_

Database

The name of the database you’d like to connect to.

Username

Your username for the database.

There may already be a default username in this field. If you don’t remember setting up a username, keep the default value.

Password

Your password associated with the username.

If you don’t remember setting up a password for your username, try leaving this field blank.

**NOTE**

For _SQLite_, instead of filling out these five database connection fields, you would enter in the file path of the _.db_ database file you are trying to connect to.

Once you fill in the database connection fields correctly, you should have access to the database. You can now use the database tool to find the tables and fields you are interested in, and start writing SQL code.

## Other Programming Languages

SQL can be written within a number of other programming languages. This chapter focuses on two popular open source ones: Python and R.

As a data scientist or data analyst, you likely do your analysis in Python or R, and also need to write SQL queries to pull data from a database.

**A BASIC DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW**

1. Write a SQL query within a database tool.
2. Export the results as a _.csv_ file.
3. Import the _.csv_ file into Python or R.
4. Continue doing analysis in Python or R.

The preceding approach is fine for doing a quick, one-time export. However, if you need to continuously edit your SQL query or are working with multiple queries, this can get annoying very quickly.

**A BETTER DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW**

1. Connect Python or R to a database.
2. Write SQL queries within Python or R.
3. Continue doing analysis in Python or R.

This second approach allows you to do all of your querying and analysis within one tool, which is helpful if you need to tweak your queries as you are doing analysis. The remainder of this chapter provides code for each step of this second workflow.

### Connect Python to a Database

It takes three steps to connect Python to a database:

1. Install a database driver for Python.
2. Set up a database connection in Python.
3. Write SQL code in Python.

#### Step 1: Install a database driver for Python

A database driver is software that helps Python talk to a database, and there are many driver options to choose from. [Table 2-2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#install\_a\_driver\_for\_python\_using\_either\_pip\_or\_conda) includes code for how to install a popular driver for each RDBMS.

This is a one-time installation you’ll need to do via either a **`pip install`** or a **`conda install`**. The following code should be run in a [terminal window](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#what\_is\_a\_terminal\_window).

| RDBMS      | Option                                                | Code                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | n/a                                                   | No install necessary (Python 3 comes with sqlite3) |
| MySQL      | pip                                                   | `pip install mysql-connector-python`               |
| conda      | `conda install -c conda-forge mysql-connector-python` |                                                    |
| Oracle     | pip                                                   | `pip install cx_Oracle`                            |
| conda      | `conda install -c conda-forge cx_oracle`              |                                                    |
| PostgreSQL | pip                                                   | `pip install psycopg2`                             |
| conda      | `conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2`               |                                                    |
| SQL Server | pip                                                   | `pip install pyodbc`                               |
| conda      | `conda install -c conda-forge pyodbc`                 |                                                    |

#### Step 2: Set up a database connection in Python

To set up a database connection, you first need to know the location and name of the database you are trying to connect to, as well as your username and password. More details can be found in [“Database Connection Fields”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#database\_connection\_fields).

[Table 2-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#python\_code\_to\_set\_up\_a\_database\_connection) contains the Python code you need to run each time you plan on writing SQL code in Python. You can include it at the top of your Python script.

| RDBMS      | Code                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | `import sqlite3 conn = sqlite3.connect('my_new_db.db')`                                                                                                                               |
| MySQL      | `import mysql.connector conn = mysql.connector.connect( host='localhost', database='my_new_db', user='alice', password='password')`                                                   |
| Oracle     | `# Connecting to Oracle Express Edition import cx_Oracle conn = cx_Oracle.connect(dsn='localhost/XE', user='alice', password='password')`                                             |
| PostgreSQL | `import psycopg2 conn = psycopg2.connect(host='localhost', database='my_new_db', user='alice', password='password')`                                                                  |
| SQL Server | `# Connecting to SQL Server Express import pyodbc conn = pyodbc.connect(driver='{SQL Server}', host='localhost\SQLEXPRESS', database='my_new_db', user='alice', password='password')` |

**TIP**

Not all arguments are required. If you exclude an argument completely, then the default value will be used. For example, the default host is _localhost_, which is your computer. If no username and password were set up, then those arguments can be left out.

**KEEPING YOUR PASSWORDS SAFE IN PYTHON**

The preceding code is fine for testing out a connection to a database, but in reality, you should not be saving your password within a script for everyone to see.

There are multiple ways to avoid doing so, including:

* generating an SSH key
* setting environment variables
* creating a configuration file

These options, however, all require additional knowledge of computers or file formats.

_The recommended approach: create a separate Python file._

The most straightforward approach, in my opinion, is to save your username and password in a separate Python file, and then call that file within your database connection script. While this is less secure than the other options, it is the quickest start.

To use this approach, start by creating a _db\_config.py_ file with the following code:

```
usr = "alice"
pwd = "password"
```

Import the _db\_config.py_ file when setting up your database connection. The following example modifies the Oracle code from [Table 2-3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#python\_code\_to\_set\_up\_a\_database\_connection) to use the _db\_config.py_ values instead of hardcoded user and password values (changes are bolded):

<pre><code>import cx_Oracle
<strong>import db_config
</strong>
conn = cx_Oracle.connect(dsn='localhost/XE',
<strong>       user=db_config.usr,
</strong><strong>       password=db_config.pwd)
</strong></code></pre>

#### Step 3: Write SQL code in Python

Once the database connection has been established, you can start writing SQL queries within your Python code.

Write a simple query to test your database connection:

```
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM test;')
result = cursor.fetchall()
print(result)
```

```
[(1, 100),
 (2, 200)]
```

**WARNING**

When using `cx_Oracle` in Python, remove the semicolon (`;`) at the end of all queries to avoid getting an error.

Save the results of a query as a pandas dataframe:

```
# pandas must already be installed
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_sql('''SELECT * FROM test;''', conn)
print(df)
print(type(df))

   id  num
0   1  100
1   2  200
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
```

Close the connection when you are done using the database:

```
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

It is always good practice to close the database connection to save resources.

**SQLALCHEMY FOR PYTHON LOVERS**

Another popular way to connect to a database is using the SQLAlchemy package in Python. It is an _object relational mapper_ (ORM), which turns database data into Python objects, allowing you to code in pure Python instead of using SQL syntax.

Imagine you want to see all the table names in a database. (The following code is PostgreSQL-specific, but SQLAlchemy will work with any RDBMS.)

Without SQLAlchemy:

```
pd.read_sql("""SELECT tablename
            FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
            WHERE schemaname='public'""", conn)
```

With SQLAlchemy:

```
conn.table_names()
```

When using SQLAlchemy, the `conn` object comes with a `table_names()` Python method, which you may find easier to remember than SQL syntax. While SQLAlchemy provides cleaner Python code, it does slow down performance due to the additional time it spends turning data into Python objects.

To use SQLAlchemy in Python:

1. You must already have a [database driver](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#install\_a\_database\_driver\_for\_python) (like `psycopg2`) installed.
2. In a terminal window, type **`pip install sqlalchemy`** or a **`conda install -c conda-forge sqlalchemy`** to install SQLAlchemy.
3. Run the following code in Python to set up a SQLAlchemy connection. (The following code is PostgreSQL-specific.) The [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://oreil.ly/QadLc) provides code for other RDBMSs and drivers:

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
conn = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://
       alice:password@localhost:5432/my_new_db')
```

### Connect R to a Database

It takes three steps to connect R to a database:

1. Install a database driver for R
2. Set up a database connection in R
3. Write SQL code in R

#### Step 1: Install a database driver for R

A database driver is software that helps R talk to a database, and there are many driver options to choose from. [Table 2-4](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#install\_a\_driver\_for\_R) includes code for how to install a popular driver for each RDBMS.

This is a one-time installation. The following code should be run in R.

#### Step 2: Set up a database connection in R

To set up a database connection, you first need to know the location and name of the database you are trying to connect to, as well as your username and password. More details can be found in [“Database Connection Fields”](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#database\_connection\_fields).

[Table 2-5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/ch02.html#r\_code\_to\_set\_up\_a\_database\_connection) contains the R code you need to run each time you plan on writing SQL code in R. You can include it at the top of your R script.

| RDBMS      | Code                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite     | `library(DBI) con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "my_new_db.db")`                                                                                                                          |
| MySQL      | `library(RMySQL) con <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host="localhost", dbname="my_new_db", user="alice", password="password")`                                                                |
| Oracle     | `library(ROracle) drv <- dbDriver("Oracle") con <- dbConnect(drv, "alice", "password", dbname="my_new_db")`                                                                                 |
| PostgreSQL | `library(RPostgres) con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), host="localhost", dbname="my_new_db", user="alice", password="password")`                                                       |
| SQL Server | `library(DBI) con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), Driver="SQL Server", Server="localhost\\SQLEXPRESS", Database="my_new_db", User="alice", Password="password", Trusted_Connection="True")` |

**TIP**

Not all arguments are required. If you exclude an argument completely, then the default value will be used.

* For example, the default host is _localhost_, which is your computer.
* If no username and password were set up, then those arguments can be left out.

**KEEPING YOUR PASSWORDS SAFE IN R**

The preceding code is fine for testing out a connection to a database, but in reality, you should not be saving your password within a script for everyone to see.

There are multiple ways to avoid doing so, including:

* encrypting credentials with the `keyring` package
* creating a configuration file with the `config` package
* setting up environment variables with an _.Renviron_ file
* recording the user and password as a global option in R with the `options` command

_The recommended approach: prompt the user for a password._

The most straightforward approach, in my opinion, is to have RStudio prompt you for your password instead.

Instead of this:

```
con <- dbConnect(...,
    password="password",
    ...)
```

Do this:

```
install.packages("rstudioapi")
con <- dbConnect(...,
    password=rstudioapi::askForPassword("Password?"),
    ...)
```

#### Step 3: Write SQL code in R

Once the database connection has been established, you can start writing SQL queries within your R code.

Show all tables in the database:

```
dbListTables(con)

[1] "test"
```

**TIP**

For _SQL Server_, include the schema name to limit the number of tables displayed—`dbListTables(con, schema="dbo")`. `dbo` stands for database owner and it is the default schema in SQL Server.

Take a look at the `test` table in the database:

```
dbReadTable(con, "test")

  id num
1  1 100
2  2 200
```

**NOTE**

For _Oracle_, the table name is case-sensitive. Since Oracle automatically converts table names to uppercase, you’ll likely need to run the following instead: `dbRead`​`Ta`⁠`ble(con, "TEST")`.

Write a simple query and output a dataframe:

```
df <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM test
                       WHERE id = 2")
print(df); class(df)

  id num
1  2 200
[1] "data.frame"
```

Close the connection when you are done using the database.

```
dbDisconnect(con)
```

It is always good practice to close the database connection to save resources.
