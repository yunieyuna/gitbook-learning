Token classification is a natural language understanding task in which a label is assigned to some tokens in a text.&#x20;

Some popular token classification subtasks are Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.&#x20;

NER models could be trained to identify specific entities in a text, such as dates, individuals and places; and PoS tagging would identify, for example, which words in a text are verbs, nouns, and punctuation marks.
